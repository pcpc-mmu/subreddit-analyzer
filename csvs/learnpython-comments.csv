Why are you casting this as a list? The return type is already a list for a map.

Edit: NB in python 2 it returns a list; in python 3 it returns an iterable map object.

    ...     return x * x

**Python2**

2020-07-16 09:15:41,crabbone,"I started as a freelancer, doing mostly graphic design, but also some Flash scripting. Back in the late 90s-early 2000s it was common for all kind of small businesses or even just individuals to have their own websites. It was kind of like having a business card. So, there was some work like that.

Then Flash really gained momentum and people were desperate to hire anyone with any knowledge of ActionScript. Demand was high, salaries were high, the entry level requirements were... having a pulse would've been a bonus. Compared to my miserable job at a newspaper, as a graphic designer, the new world of programming was a lavish, incredible upgrade. So, I interviewed for a couple of companies that looked for ActionScript programmer, chose one that looked most attractive and went to work there.

Correct.  Higher resolution means more image detail.

&gt; The more pixels per inch, the greater the resolution.

Not when you do what you're doing.  You're not getting more detail.

&gt; Generally, an image with a higher resolution produces a better printed image quality.

Definitely not in your case.  You're not adding useful information.

Again, you need a better method for taking the picture."

There are also [various filters](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.3.x/reference/ImageFilter.html) you can apply.  The ""calculate a pixel value from others around it"" idea is called ""convolution"" and you can play around with that using the [PIL.ImageFilter.Kernel()](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.3.x/reference/ImageFilter.html#PIL.ImageFilter.Kernel) method.

2020-07-16 08:51:14,billsil,"Doubling pixels doesn't increase resolution.  It increases the number of pixels.  The amount of information per data is the same, but you're just taking up more space.

Take a higher quality picture.  I assume it's just from a screenshot, so you can render the screen at 10k and tile the viewport without ever showing it.  You don't even need to tile it yourself.  You just set the oversampling factor.  You only see what's actually going on when you get a memory error.

2020-07-16 08:50:11,yawpitch,"The **readlines** method on a file doesn’t strip the newline character, so assuming your file is just a new word on every line then:

     about

Becomes `[“about\n”, “ado\n”, “append\n”]`, and so no word _can_ end with “o”.

The proper way to do this (including handling the file correctly and also ignoring extra whitespace) would be:

    with open(“yourfile”) as src:
        for line in src:
            word = line.strip()
            if word.endswith(“o”):

When you just `print` inside of `__str__`, Python complains because you don't return anything (which implicitly returns `None`). It only seems to work in your case because you're expecting to print out the representation immediately. If instead I wanted to store the string representation, things go wrong with your second example:

    x = str(b) # prints out ""Animal Farm ...""
    print(x) # 'None'"

2020-07-16 06:50:01,socal_nerdtastic,"All python functions and methods return something. If you don't specify what to return, python returns None by default. 

Combine that with the fact that some magic methods are required to return a string and you have that error. 

You are welcome to print *as well*, if you want, but you must return a string. 

    def __str__(self):
        print(f""{self.title} by {self.author}"")
        return '' # return a blank string just to shut up the python error"

df\_1 has 'Key', 'Class A', 'Class B'

df\_2 has 'Key' and 'Lookup Value'

There are 12K unique keys in each file (1:1 ratio, which I know since I split the file) but pandas is only spitting out the 48."
