Hmm Python noob here, didn't realize that, was always putting a print afterwards lol. 

So msg will be printed in the lines 12 or 14 depending on whether it is too high or too low, and what `msg += string` does is append the new string to msg. So if `msg = ""hello""` and `string = "" world""` then `msg += string` becomes `'hello world'`.  

So every guess you enter is appended to msg. So if you enter 20, and 30, and they are both too low, then msg becomes.  
`20 is too low.`

Useful for what? The ""framework"" vs. ""library"" distinction is handwavy to begin with, but in my view, a library provides code that you run, and a framework runs code that you provide. Look at the quickstart guides for Flask and Requests and you can kind of see the difference - you work with Requests by calling its functions, and you work with Flask by providing functions that it calls."

2020-06-25 19:18:55,17291,"**Suggestion 1:** Be specific about which errors you're trying to catch. For example, in the mkfile command:

    try:
        open(string, ""x"")
        print(""File made"")
    except:
        print(""ERROR - couldn't create the file"")

If the file can't be created for whatever reason, you'll encounter an OSError (or some subclass of it, like FileExistsError or FileNotFoundError). So instead, write 

    try:
        open(string, ""x"")
        print(""File made"")
    except OSError:
        print(""ERROR - couldn't create the file"")

That way, if you encounter an unexpected error in your `try` block, you'll still see the traceback.

**Suggestion 2:** Some commands end in `()`, some don't. I see the distinction (commands ending in () don't have any additional arguments), but I think it would be better if you made them all the same.

**Suggestion 3:** Instead of using `re.sub` to separate the command from the arguments, maybe using the split method."
2020-06-25 19:15:29,JohnnyJordaan,"1. The line `guess = int(input(msg + ""\nGuess my number between 1 and 1000: ""))` includes `msg` so it gets printed on a line before the prompt for the guess.
2. It basically explains how it works: as the `input()` call includes `msg` it will be printed every time that call is made. In case you're still struggling: `input()` is a combination of a `print()` and a prompt waiting for user input, terminated by the enter key. So by incorporating *extra* string data in that call (putting `msg + ` in front of what you want to print), you can print more than just the question to enter data.

2020-06-25 18:14:42,phenderbender,"Well, docker essentially takes some configuration files (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, requirements.txt, etc) and uses those as blueprints for building your containers/applications. I’m new to it myself but suggest going through docker’s tutorials in their documentation as well as some basic tutorials others have done on YouTube or googling it. It’s really powerful what you can put together, but there’s definitely a learning curve. 

No need to include the docker software in your repo, the end user should just already have docker itself installed beforehand. 

So the idea is you write your configuration files, scripts etc. and put them in your git repo, then you can share that repo with someone who can just clone your repo and spin up the whole application quickly and easily

I think you’d similarly benefit from github tutorials to understand how and why to use it"

In my opinion... Even more important than all of these problems we're faced with today, is the absence of a proper system of control.

We have... ""government"", of course. But that's really 99% politics. It's as much *governance* as the medical field was about 200 years ago. And it was really good, two hundred + years ago. But in that time, an actual science of governance has emerged called Cybernetics. And unfortunately it remains largely absent from ""government"".

Independent of this, it's also incredibly useful in programming, and essentially everything.

2020-06-25 17:32:45,Diapolo10,"Technically, it isn't. It just happens to have the same end result.

The `[:]` is slicing syntax; slices produce new values of the same type between a beginning and ending index with an optional step value. In this particular case the entire list gets sliced as the indexes default to `None` which in this case means it slices from the beginning of the list all the way to the end. You'll end up with a new list that contains the same references as the original list, so a shallow copy, same as what `list.copy` returns.

Note the *shallow*-part; if the original list contains anything mutable, that value will still be shared by the original list and the copies/slices of it, meaning that if you change it in one of them it'll change in all of them. Demonstration:

    original = [
        [3, 1, 4],
    ]

    cpy = original.copy()
    cpy[0].append(1)

    print(original[0]) # [3, 1, 4, 1]

To get around this, you can use `copy.deepcopy`:

    from copy import deepcopy

    original = [
        [3, 1, 4],
    ]

    cpy = deepcopy(original)
    cpy[0].append(1)

&amp;#x200B;

We've been given the assignment to check if a word follows a pattern, including a placeholder. eg. l?ad could be lead, and we've been encouraged to use recursion.

&amp;#x200B;

Running the program in the IDE causes my function to return none, so I stuck it in [http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html](http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html), and saw that, step by step, it did return the correct true/false value, but didn't break, going through lines within the function and getting rid of the correct return value. The function I'm struggling with is as follows: - my plan is to replace each ? with the relevant letter from the word, recurring until there are no ?s left, then checking if the pattern and the word are equal.

I would like it to not return none, and instead return true or false.

&amp;#x200B;

    def match(pattern,word):
        if pattern.count(""?"") != 0:
            loc_q = pattern.find(""?"")
            pattern = pattern[0:loc_q:1] + word[loc_q] + pattern[loc_q+1::1]
            match(pattern,word)
                
        elif pattern == word:
            return True    
        elif pattern != word:
            return False"
2020-06-25 17:07:26,skellious,"Python CAN be quick, if you use a lot of C calls, either by writing them manually, using a module wrapped around c functions (like the python math module wraps mathematical functions written in C for example) or by using Cython, which is a superset of python that compiles to C. 

Python is often used for AI and neural nets so its not by any means slow, its just how you use it that is important. 

C would be quicker because it compiles directly to machine code, whereas python is an interpreted language so each line in the python file has to be read by the interpreter program as it's going (at run-time), combine this with python not having static variables (you don't have to say that a string is a string when you make the variable, python just works it out automatically). This is a huge advantage in reducing complexity but it means the program can't make assumptions that a certain variable will always be a certain type, it must test every time. 

This, along with many other reasons, makes python about 100x slower than C on average. but as I say, with Cython or by using python modules written in C in the right way, you can get much much faster results.

2020-06-25 16:24:02,kyber,"Allow me to build on that with something posted elsewhere on this topic.

The names of function parameters (when defining function) / arguments (calling function) have no bearing on each other, they are completely independent and are named for convenience of the human reader. Whether the same names or completely different names are used makes no difference.


Variables in Python don't have values, but references to Python objects, that is some implementation specific way for Python to know where an object is held in memory.


When you define a function, you (optionally) define parameters. These are essentially variables used only within that function. When the function is called, arguments are provided that map 1:1 with the parameters (in the same order). That is, the object reference of the first argument is assigned to the first parameter, and so on.


The arguments will consist of any combination of:


* variable - i.e. a reference to an object
* an expression - perhaps another function call - that will resolve to a literal object or reference to an object
* a literal object, like a ""string""


The names in parameters and arguments don't need to match, but it is good to make them relatable in the human language of the developers concerned to avoid confusion. Consider the problems of the below:


    def f(two, three, four):
        return two + three * four




    one = 2
    two = 5
    three = 4


    print(f(three, two, one))


the above will print 14. This might take you a while to see. It is the POSITION order of parameters and arguments that are matched (there are options to specify the parameter names in the call, but let's not go there).


Some objects, like tuples, lists, strings, dictionaries, are iterable containers / sequences (actually, a collection of references to objects). Iterable means you can step through it.


A `for` loop exploits the method every iterable has to be repeatedly asked for its next item, generating an *exception* when all the items are exhausted, which the mechanism of the `for` loop is waiting for to know it should finish.


On each iteration of the `for` loop, the variable is assigned the reference to each successive object returned by the source objects iteration method. (A `for` loop can assign multiple variables when the object reference returned on each iteration is to an object itself containing more than one element - this is called *unpacking*.)"
2020-06-25 16:21:48,bidby_,"Yeah I think I need to rethink things a little bit... I'm definitely guilty of reading about all these extra things, and then immediately wanting to use them in my code, even if they don't fit the problem I'm facing.  


So what I'm actually doing: 

`Main_Thing` is just a custom openai gym environment, with lots of potential parameters that could be looked at for info

`Other_Thing` was supposed to be ~~an object~~ a thing that holds different pairs of functions designed to interpret the environments varied parameters/attributes and output appropriate observations/rewards that could easily be interpreted by an reinforcement learning agent or generic control device."

I'm still thinking in functions. 

I guess my different flavours of `Main_Thing` , each with slightly different functionality, is something that could be handled instead by inheritance..? Like I write a `Main_Thing` that includes `TypeA` internally (as a bound method); and then I write a new class for `TypeB` that inherits from `Main_Thing` where I overwrite the `TypeA` bound method with `TypeB`'s functionality..?

2020-06-25 15:19:39,crashfrog,"The actual solution here is to re-architect your whole design - the cyclomatic complexity is dizzying, I strongly suspect your classes don't model your *actual important entities* (I'm sure `Main_Thing` is just an example, but still), and any time you're reaching for parameterized reflection (i.e. passing a parameter that means ""look on an object for the attribute of this name"") you should have a very strong framework-level reason for wanting to do that, and you don't. And you're defeating the whole purpose of classes with `TypeA` and `TypeB`.

Your problem here is that you're applying what looks like a *very* functional design to classes, where it doesn't work. You're still looking at your classes as things that *do* things instead of as things that *are* things, and that's why the class abstraction isn't making things any clearer for you. I'm not saying functions shouldn't ever be arguments to `__init__`, but given that we've *got* a way to set bound methods on instance objects by defining them in the class *already*, you should have a better explanation than you do about why you can't define all of an object's methods up front.

I am still at a point in my grad school career that most of my EDA isn't repetitive. When my project comes together, I'm planning on making a class with methods to make my analysis repeatable. I think it's very important to write it this way, but it doesn't make sense to do this yet.

My question is, if you are doing simple EDA that you do not plan to repeat, would you write a function every time you manipulate a dataframe? It seems to be a lot of extra work (for someone like me!) for when I just want to get a look at a slice of a dataframe.

For example:
I wanted to look at the rows of a data frame that meet a condition from specific columns I would write: (pardon syntax errors, like I said, I'm a novice)

    filtered_df = df.loc[df['var'] &gt; 50, ['column1', 'column2']]

If you were going to do something similar would you define a new function where you would end up with something like:

    filtered_df = remove_unhelpful(df)

I'm wondering how often you would elect to use the strategy you've presented here vs allowing for something quick and dirty for notebook purposes only.

The problem is converting a [number to roman numeral](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/class-exercises/python-class-exercise-1.php). The bit I don't understand is how val\[i\] in line 18 is exactly the place holder you want it to be. For example with the number 300 val\[i\] would be a hundred but earlier in the code it set I to 0 meaning (at least initially) val\[i\] should be 1000 no?

What do you mean by calling order? I sort of assumed you're code abstracts away the graphing method. That is, it's not available to the user.

It might be okay, it might not be okay. It depends on the context. What are you making? A program with a narrow focus? An application? A library?

If you can guarantee that this method will always produce a sensible name then you're fine. If not, don't use it.

2020-06-25 12:59:05,Atlantis_One,"So it depends a little. Usually it is best to import tkinter as follows: `import tkinter as tk` and to use the tkinter options, you call them by putting `tk` before what you want to call. This avoids any problems with conflicting libraries. So it would be `entry_1 = tk.Entry(root)`. However, what you have is not necessary wrong. That would work, as long as you don't forget to `.pack()` or `.grid()` the entry widget of course.

As for the checkbuttons and the `tk.BooleanVar()` (I misremembered it as `tk.BoolVar()`): as I said, if you just google 'tkinter checkbuttons' (or 'tkinter booleanvar' if you want to learn specifically about those), there are plenty of explanations and examples on how to use those. Your first option when stuck with the problem (as trying it for yourself), should be to look it up. If you looked it up (preferably multiple resources) and you still don't understand the concept or cannot find anything, you can always ask it. However it should not be your first option, especially for something simple and basic with plenty of resources. It is a very valuable skill to learn how to research a problem, because you can't always rely on people doing your basic research for you."

&gt; You should check at some interval (every frame?) whether the snake and a dot occupy the same space. If they do, remove the dot.

I had the idea of comparing the coordinates of the dot and the snake, but I do not know how to check the position of the snake while it\`s moving. Though, I would be able to work with it if the snake moves 1 space at a time, as I can get coordinates when where it stops and compare it there.

&gt; For the dot it's probably one. What about the snake? 

For simplicity\`s sake, I will keep it down to a single 1 on its head. Its size would probably be included in the calculation in some form of leniency while checking the coordinates, like giving 1 extra tolerance space around where the head can be.

2020-06-25 11:45:35,AttachmentAnxiety,"I think interesting things to do when you're starting out is doing some tutorials and lessons on requests and accessing APIs, because there is a LOT of really interesting data out there, often completely for free, where you can grab that data and just think of things you could do with it, and try to build something that does something cool with that data. 
 
I mean even Steam has an API you can access. I've been meaning to read the documentation on the Steam API and see if there's anything interesting it can give you access to, especially if it's live updates.  
 
I also found this [really cool and simple API](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/) that provides live data about where the ISS is, what it's doing, etc so I've been trying to write something that takes in this data like the ISS coordinates, compares it to data sets that have geographical data like coordinates tied to location names that I found online on government sites after lots of googling, and have it tell me when the ISS is flying over any location in those data sets. I'm also having it tell me how far away the ISS is from straight above me.  
  
All I was doing at first was trying to get the API info in with requests, and to print the current ISS coordinates formatted into a nice little string and do it once every couple of seconds. It was really simple, and there's even lessons and guides that do this. Then I started getting more ideas like above.  
  
I didn't know how to do any of this, or if I even could, but one problem at a time led to googling, which led to copying down comments and notes and links, learning, trying it and getting errors, googling those errors, leading to more tutorials and documents, to things actually working. Like I had to Google ""how to get distance between two coordinates"", and found a Python example of it. That taught me the haversine formula that I still don't understand but was able to copy and paste it, filling in my own variables, and led me to learning about other things like how longitude and latitude work, refreshing me on math i had completely wiped from my brain like what radians are, how long a degree of latitude is in kilometers and miles, how big the earth is, how to work with data sets in pandas, how to do memory map it and do it really quickly with vaex (though this one I'm still struggling to get to work) so that hopefully, eventually I can have it show me the real world location of the ISS every single update based on its coordinates with no big performance hit.  
 
When you give yourself a really simple project to do that is open ended and has data coming in for you, it can really open things up as far as giving you ideas on other things you could add to your project, and that's where the rabbit hole starts I think. That's where you keep refreshing all these fundamentals in your head and keep learning new things and growing."

2020-06-25 10:29:17,AttachmentAnxiety,"Well things like converting your input to int is still worrying about the type, of course. Since you want to add it to another number, it has to be an int or float coming in, instead of a string, or else when you try to do that math inside the curly braces, it'll give you a ValueErrror. You can except and catch those errors if you expect them, of course, but no you'll still need to keep track of what types you're using in a lot of cases.  
  
It's just that f-strings will automatically format the result of the code inside the curly braces, to a string in the end, and put it all together for you. It also runs that code in the curly braces at run time so it's faster than other ways of formatting strings.  
  
So f-strings are used when your end result needs to be a string. It's way better for formatting strings, way more readable code, than say using older concatenation method and other outdated methods like %s."
2020-06-25 10:28:55,crabbone,"&gt; My question is - how did the author know to use [printer] and [""device-uri""] to print this information?

You can always call `dir()` on a Python object to see (more or less) the list of the fields it has (it will also give you the list of methods, but this cannot predict existence of dynamic properties or methods).

My general strategy of working with undocumented code is to add a breakpoint in my code using s.o. elese's code:

    import pdb
    pdb.set_trace()

and then use debugger's functions to explore the objects I have to work with.

Another thing that may help you: say, you managed to import `pycups`, but you cannot locate its source code, then you could do:

    import pycups
    pycups.__file__

will give you the location of the loaded package.

Also, I guess you know this, but just in case: CUPS has a web interface. You can just open your browser on http://localhost:631 and then you can use the debug tools of your browser to see the requests it's sending to the server and what the responses look like (assuming it's using the same API)."

2020-06-25 10:26:55,Skasch,"Your question actually touches a very deep, interesting and complex problem in software design: idempotency. An operation is idempotent if running it twice leave your system in the same state as running it once. As you noticed, an idempotent operation is really helpful: you don't have to worry about running it multiple times, as it won't screw up your system.

More generally, it's really useful to have idempotent operations. Let's say for example I want to create a user on a database. Because the network is a bit iffy, I end up sending the same request twice. If the back-end process to add the user is idempotent, then it's not a problem: it will create the user once, and the second request won't do anything. If it wasn't, it could have created a second identical user, which could cause a lot of problems! Imagine for example the same thing happening when you make an online payment.

Back to the problem here: when I work with pandas dataframes, I try to avoid overriding previously created variables, for that same reason. The problem is, you may have a lot of consecutive operations on you table, and it's annoying to give each intermediate step a new name. That's exactly when I start factoring these operations into separate functions. I don't really mind overriding a local variable inside a function, as it will be dropped anyway at the end. Once I have my function, I can simply write

    filtered_reviews = remove_unhelpful(reviews)

To apply my logic."
2020-06-25 10:18:13,crabbone,"I don't believe that's legal in Python: names of identifiers cannot start with digit.

Also, `image[:, i]` is not a number, it's an array of one dimension less than `image` (most likely a unidimensional array). Comparing it to a number... is likely undefined / perhaps is always false, and that's why you are filling it all with zeros.

So... essentially, you want a ""threshold"" operation, right?  You don't need loops for that. You can [reshape](https://numpy.org/doc/1.18/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html) the image array to be unidimensional, and then create your ""thresholded"" image like this:

2020-06-25 10:16:41,MrJKeating,"You are not using block comments. You would want to use a line comment for this. It would be clear that it only applies to this line. A block comment applies to the whole block. But your code only has one top level block. It’s everything from `url = ` to the `print` call. That is your block.

I think you may have a misunderstanding of what a block is in python. Have you ever had an exception occur that said `Expected an indented block`? That gives you a good feeling for what a block is. A block isn’t just some arbitrary lines of code.

    for i in range(10):  # This is a block comment
        pass
    else:  # This is another block comment
        pass

The first block comment applies to the first block.

To answer your question: There is no way to end block comments because you are using them wrong. 

# Solution to your specific problem:

Simply don’t use comments in this case.
They add no value here.
Thai whole code should be wrapped in a single function with this signature:

    def title_from_url(url):
        pass 

It’s completely unambiguous what this function does. You don’t even need comments or a docstring here.
Code is the best documentation you can write.
Don’t make comments that repeat the code.

If you have a comment that says `create a ""soup"" object` there’s 2 scenarios:

1. The person reading this knows what beautiful soup is. They won’t need the comment to know what’s happening here (if you hadn’t wrapped the single line in a function)
2. They don’t know what beautiful soup is. In this case, the comment is of no value to them because it doesn’t give them more information."

The general idea here is that you write C code that creates a shared library that can be later loaded by Python: for this, you need to implement certain functions in that library. 

This is your entry into documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/index.html

There are plenty of other languages which can create shared libraries that can be loaded by Python. For example, Rust, C++, Fortran, to some extent Go. And, if you are willing to work a bit harder: anything that can produce a shared library can, in principle, be a Python module."

MIT has been teaching python in their cs courses for over a decade, and I believe they're all available online. As one option.  
  
If the goal is just general knowledge of the language, I'd actually say a course would be painfully dull, as the target audience is usually beginners. Rather, I'd say to learn from a book, or through building simple projects, and looking up the python way to do it. as I imagine, you might be able to solve it via js, so its not as if the concepts are the challenge; rather, just familiarizing yourself with how to implement various things you already know  
  
If you wanted a book: 'Fluid Python' is one id recommend, but its quite advanced, and would likely be overwhelming if not familiar with python syntax, but once you're a bit more familiar you can certainly give it a try. If your goal is to really learn the language, and the pythonic way of doing things, that's a strong recommend

There used to be a game called mastermind here in the UK, where you had to guess the colour of 4 pegs, at each stage you would get clues as to whether any of the pegs were the right colour, or the right colour and in the right location.

Maybe don't do too much on one line and split it up further to get clarity about what is going on.

(Note, it's the official documentation site. You are expected to take a look at it BEFORE asking questions.)

 

    Path.mkdir(mode=0o777, parents=False, exist_ok=False)

Create a new directory at this given path. If *mode* is given, it is combined with the process’ umask  
 value to determine the file mode and access flags. If the path already exists, [FileExistsError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#FileExistsError) is raised.

If *parents* is true, any missing parents of this path are created as needed; they are created with the default permissions without taking *mode* into account (mimicking the POSIX mkdir -p  
 command).

If *parents* is false (the default), a missing parent raises [FileNotFoundError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#FileNotFoundError).

If *exist\_ok* is false (the default), [FileExistsError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#FileExistsError) is raised if the target directory already exists.

If *exist\_ok* is true, [FileExistsError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#FileExistsError) exceptions will be ignored (same behavior as the POSIX mkdir -p  
 command), but only if the last path component is not an existing non-directory file.

2020-06-25 06:26:52,Uncle_DirtNap,"/u/Atlantis_One is correct, re-organizing your program will help dramatically.  You can break your program into functions, and you can also use classes (more on that shortly), but another thing that will help you a lot is improving your data structures.  For example, you've hit upon using the `quizzdata` list to contain both the questions and the answers, but you could have simply put them directly into quizzdata and restructured your code to make it actually simpler.  It might seem that having the question text in a separate list, but that's not necessarily the case, and not at all in the case of your program.  Even if it was, it's both more pythonic and makes more sense to define the entire data structure and then extract from it if you need to, meaning:

    quizzdata = [
        ('my question text', 'a'),
        ('my other question', 'c'),
    ]
    questions = [q for q, _ in quizzdata]

because in that case you aren't trying to match questions up to answers by numerical index, you can go to one place if you want to change something, etc.  Speaking of anti-patterns in data structures, `bannedletterarray` is not a habit you want to get into.

So, it's not _super_ clear from your commented out line what you wanted the `quiz` class to do or what question you have, but here's an example class that might be an improvement for you.  Note a few things:

1. this handles the above problem with the data structure
2. this gets rid of `bannedletterarray`
3. you don't need to have your quiz answers be in a particular order (in fact it's often better for them not to be
4. your questions don't need to have the same number of options
5. your current questions and answers have formatting in them (i.e., newlines), which aren't actually part of the questions or answers, but are the result of how you later want to display them.

        guess = input('What is your guess?')
        if qq.check_guess(guess):
            print('good job!')

So the idea here is that you are:

1. Grouping together relevant data -- that is, the instance of `QuizQuestion` has all the data necessary for the question, no unnecessary data, and stores it in a useful way
2. All the methods that operate on the data are stored with the data (not really, I only showed one method as an example, you may have more in reality)
3. The data is validated
4. The class is easy to create instances of and to use those instances.

This is just an example class based on a guess of what you might have wanted from your comment.

We're hashing and salting in this case so that there's reduced weakness from a DB leak. I don't need to know your password, but I need to be able to reference it. If there's a leak of salted and hashed values, this is much less of a crisis than a leak of plaintext passwords, for obvious reasons."

2020-06-25 05:16:04,01123581321AhFuckIt,"Came up with a very dirty/inelegant solution that works and uses NumPy.

&amp;#x200B;

    gradelist = sorted(df['Grade'].unique())
    failslist = sorted(df['Classes Failing'].unique())
    list = []
    for grade in gradelist:
        for fails in failslist:
            countbyfilter = len(df_by_student_fail_by_grade[df_by_student_fail_by_grade['Grade']==grade][df_by_student_fail_by_grade['Classes Failing']==fails].index)
            list.append(countbyfilter)
    dffails = pd.DataFrame(np.asarray(list).reshape(4,5).tolist(),index=['9th Grade','10th Grade','11th Grade','12th Grade'],columns=['1 class','2 classes','3 classes','4 classes','5 classes'])

Basically what I did was create a sorted list of unique column values for grade and classes failing. gradelist = \[9,10,11,12\], failslist=\[1,2,3,4,5\].

I then create an empty list for which I will append certain values from a for loop.

 Basically the for loop will go through each grade. While in each grade it will go through each amount of classes failed. In the for loop what I'm basically doing is filtering by each condition (9th grade - 1 fails, 9th grade - 2 fails, etc.) and counting the amount of rows in the df created from the filter as that will give me the amount of students. I then append that to the empty list. 

Now i have the issue of turning that list into a dataframe in the shape I want. Easiest way to do that was to convert it into a numpy array, reshape it into the shape I want, then turn it back into a list of lists for pandas to turn into a data frame. The end result (with my actual data):

                     1 class    2 classes  3 classes  4 classes  5 classes
    9th Grade        24         14         15         29         23
    10th Grade       12         16         12         15         35
    11th Grade       20          9          7         10          8

The function(s) that get called should know or find out which Entry widget was changed and update the other appropriate Entry widgets.

When bundled into an executable it's still looking using the same relative path, but the executable is starting from a different directory and it cannot find anything with the given path.

Think of it like giving someone directions. If you say go down two streets turn left and it's the third house on the right. Those directions only work if the person is starting from the same place you were using as a starting point.

If they were one intersection further away when the started to follow your directions, they would turn left too soon and end up at the wrong house.

If you want to send emails I would suggest looking at something like AWS's SES or other SMTP servers. I would not suggest running an SMTP server yourself, they are not worth the risk, headache or bounce rate

With that out the way...

My girlfriend uses Gmail so I just use Gmail's SMTP server to send the emails. You need to allow your code to send emails from your Gmail address.  You can do that at the following URLs:

* https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha
* https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps

* To create a nice looking email I uses Jinja2 (needs to be installed via pip), 
* To create the email I use Python's `email` module

&gt; Is it even considered bad style doing sth. from scratch and you should always go for a good library if possible?

It depends on the circumstances. There are plenty of mature, well-designed and extensively tested libraries that can save you a huge amount of time and effort. There are also plenty of crappy libraries that are full of bugs and just needlessly complicate things. I think in general it's good to at least be aware what libraries are available and what they're capable of before spending a lot of time coding something up yourself."

youtube-dl is still there and is the de-facto standard for youtube downloading and YouTube has changed a lot since the first release of youtube-dl more than 8 years ago!

Not necessarily, if you're using a library, especially one that's widely used and is open-source, it can just be forked by anyone and the project can continue even if the original developers have stopped working on it!

2020-06-25 04:21:16,ka-splam,"&gt; I was expecting 1's and 0's in octets like 01001101, 00101101, etc. Can someone explain this binary representation to me?

You gotta stare at it for a while to see the different levels. What you post here `01001101` is eight characters in a string. `0` is ASCII character code 48 and `1` is ASCII character code 49. Now you're representing 8 bits of data using 8 characters which are actually using 64 bits of data.

`J` is one character, code 74, now you're representing 8 bits using a single 8-bit character.

Separately from that, looking at a long stream of `01001101 00101101 01001101 00101011 11001101 00111101` is quite difficult for humans to read and work with as it all looks ""the same"", and when it also takes up 8x more space and conversion time to represent it like that *and* doesn't map directly bit-for-bit with what's happening internally, it's not such a useful representation.

At the same time, a stream of normal counting numbers (base 10) like 20 142 99 84 is easier to read, but is also hard for humans to work with, and doesn't map very clearly to what's happening behind the scenes.

As a halfway-house, hexadecimal base-16 counting `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F` like `0B` and `AA`, each digit maps exactly to all possible states of 4-bits, and two digits maps exactly onto 8 bits. That's very convenient and useful. It's not so hard for humans to learn to work with, and is much shorter than `01001101`.

The `\x0b` indicates these are hexadecimal, in Python syntax. Different systems indicate this in different ways. Python showing some values as `\x11` and some as `J` is a weird design choice by them, IMO."
2020-06-25 04:21:04,ninety_hex,"Well, you are trying to convert the data you read from the file into an `int` so if the file contains `999.00` you will get an exception trying to convert the string from the file to an `int`.  You have to write the function to handle float values.

Additionally, your function is a little confused.  In cases like this the function would read the file, if it exists, and just return the value in the file.  If the file isn't there then it should just return the default maximum value and rely on the code that saves the maximum value at the end of the program to create the file.  Making it as simple as possible, here's how I would do the read/write of the file.

    def read_alltimebestime():
        try:
            with open(""besttime.txt"", 'r') as fd:
                data = fd.read()         # we expect just the number string, no need to slice and dice
        except FileNotFoundError:
            return 9999999

        try:
            nums = int(data)
        except ValueError:
            nums = 9999999

        return nums

    def write_alltimebestime(t):
        with open(""besttime.txt"", 'w') as fd:
            fd.write(str(t))

    t = read_alltimebestime()
    new_t = t - 1
    print(f'New all time best={new_t}')
    write_alltimebestime(new_t)

If you want to handle float values in the file you must change the read/write funtions to handle float values."

2020-06-25 04:14:30,nodnarbiter,"So basically, the difference is that if statements only check one condition. Is my thing true or false? An elif checks two conditions. Was the thing before me false and is my thing true or false? An elif statement can only run if the previous if/elif is false AND it's condition is true. An if just runs if it's condition is true."
2020-06-25 04:12:47,RnDes,"In english, if may represents a single conditional branch of code. Branching allows you to selectively skip code based upon the status of an indicator - would highly recommend watching a simple tutorial on LC3 assembly or general flow charts.

An else if, elif, statement is an appendage onto the if statement that only executes should the conditions for the if statement fail (false boolean) - you branch to another branch statement.

For example, if you're driving a vehicle and encounter a sign, you might perform several actions depending uppn its color. You might check that it's not red like a stop sign first, and then check if it's yellow. 

If(red):
     Print(red)
Else if(yellow):
     Print(yellow)


Here, the else if statement only executes if the sign is not red and is yellow. The if statement executes if the sign is red, running the line print(red), then proceeds to skip the code enclosed by the ""else if(yellow)"" block.

2020-06-25 03:56:53,ninety_hex,"The short answer is no, in the sense you mean, but it's a bit more complicated that that.  Here's a simple `testa.py`:

    import testb
    print(f'testa: math.sqrt(42))={math.sqrt(42)}')

and a `testb.py`:

    import math
    print(f'testb: math.sqrt(10)={math.sqrt(10)}')

When we execute `testa.py` we see:

    testb: math.sqrt(10)=3.1622776601683795     # importing testb executes code in testb.py
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File ""testa.py"", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
        print(f'testa: math.sqrt(42))={math.sqrt(42)}')
    NameError: name 'math' is not defined

We see that the code in `testb.py` can execute the `math.sqrt()` method in the module it imported, but `testa.py` can't because the module `testb` hasn't been imported in the `testa.py` file.

-----

The longer answer is that the module imported in `testb.py` *can* be accessed and used in the `testa.py` module.  Try adding a line before the failing line in `testa.py`:

    import testb
    print(f'testa: testb.math.sqrt(42))={testb.math.sqrt(42)}')
    print(f'testa: math.sqrt(42))={math.sqrt(42)}')

Now you see this printed:

    testb: math.sqrt(10)=3.1622776601683795
    testa: testb.math.sqrt(42))=6.48074069840786     # can access the ""math"" linrary in ""testb""
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File ""testa.py"", line 3, in &lt;module&gt;
        print(f'testa: math.sqrt(42))={math.sqrt(42)}')
    NameError: name 'math' is not defined

However, this is not something you should do.  It's far better to be explicit and import modules that are used in a file **in that file**.  If `testa` code wants to use the `math` module code it should import it."

When you reference a variable, Python looks up the symbol starting in the most local scope and going ""outwards"", to the global scope. Thus variables defined in global scope are accessible in any function. But when you *assign* to a variable, the assignment happens in the most local scope unless you declare otherwise; thus, variables defined inside a function aren't accessible from outside of it."

The code compares `passcode` against `attempt` to see if they are equal, but `attempt` is always an empty string.  You overwrite the value in `passcode` from the input statement on the `randint()` line.  Maybe you should change that line to:

    attempt = randint(0, 10)

You have a second problem now.  `passcode` will always be a string, yet `attempt` will always be an integer becase that's what `randint(0, 10)` returns.  You probably need to convert the string from the input to an integer."

The first line is not needed as you define the list on the second line. Your mistake is that you're checking to see if something is in l, when l is still empty at the time you're looking at it.

    l=[a for a in set(x)]

or

     l=[a for a in x if x.count(a) == 1]

That second way is truly horrible by the way and you should never do it like that becasue the count function is looking at the list again for each element in a. Awful.

I know you said no sets. But for removing duplicates it's your best bet unless you want to loop over the list multiple times."

I'm thinking a list that you keep appending to forever, maybe `tile_list` is a possible one to grow and grow?

Maybe print `len(tile_list)` in a few places and see if it looks about the size you expect.

Anywhere you have `.append()` or `+=` is somewhere to look closely at, and all loops `for thing in XYZ:` have a think about how many times you expect them to loop like ""once per enemy on screen"" and then print/track/count if that's actually happening correctly as it slows down and down. Possibly one of them is doing more and more loops because of a mistake or misunderstanding?"

2020-06-25 02:36:35,Markmonster25,when i needed speed for one of my functions i wrote what needed to be run fast in a c++ dll then imported it to my python script like its explained in this post [https://stackoverflow.com/a/55509725](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55509725)
2020-06-25 02:35:47,Lewri,"By phase I mean shifting to the left/right, for example a cosine graph is just a sine graph with a phase of -π/2. By shift I just mean the vertical shift up and down the y axis. Instead of period, I've put angular frequency which relates to period. Angular frequency is 2πf which is 2π/T.

Once you've got the generated parameters, you can use them to generate the fit using the function we defined earlier. First make an array of x-values to use, you could just use your original data x-values, but it's better to create a new array so that you can have smaller steps between the values for a more detailed graph. Use [numpy.linspace](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html#numpy.linspace): `y_fit = np.linspace(start, stop, number)`, the higher the number value you use the finer the result but the longer the computation.

Then just plug into the function we defined earlier:

```
y_fit = []

for value in x_fit:
    result = function(value, popt[0], popt[1], popt[2], popt[3])
    y_fit.append(result)
```

So we now have an array of x values and an array of corresponding y values for the best fit. We can use a library called matplotlib to graph this and the original data:

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(xdata, ydata)
plt.plot(x_fit, y_fit)
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Temperature')
plt.title('My Graph')
plt.show()
```

If they seem to match, then you're probably good."

Education/learning/practice? In the beginning everything from scratch. Try to at least code everything you use as a module once.

Everyday stuff/doing stuff for the resume? Using stuff like itertools and pyenchant(dictionaries of different languages) is common practice. You might want to avoid using modules for the more complex parts though if it’s for resume.

Job/performance-based/...? Many libraries offer optimized code-solutions(not all!) and are sometimes even written in a better performing language (C). Also most of the Time you’re not starting from scratch (I'd recommend saving and reusing code you’ve written before) so why avoid using those modules?

    def sawFull(list,targetHarm):
        if targetHarm==1:
            return makeSine(list,1)
        else:
            return([x + y for x, y in zip_longest(sawFull(list,targetHarm-1),makeSine(list,targetHarm),fillvalue=0)])

First let's identify where we make recursive calls

    return([x + y for x, y in zip_longest(sawFull(list,targetHarm-1),makeSine(list,targetHarm),fillvalue=0)])
    [x + y for x, y in zip_longest(sawFull(list,targetHarm-1),makeSine(list,targetHarm),fillvalue=0)]
    zip_longest(sawFull(list,targetHarm-1),makeSine(list,targetHarm),fillvalue=0)
    sawFull(list,targetHarm-1)

So now I see where we are doing recursion.
I would check to see if this [tail-recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call) but  the answer here is no which means that I'll need to work a bit to eliminate recursion.

Now, I have a choice, do I solve this the smart way or the simple way.
First I'll try the smart way and see if that works.

## Smart way

First, we should ask

&gt; Why do we recurse? What value does `sawFull(list, targetHarm-1)` provide us?

Unfortunately, I'm not familiar enough with your problem domain to explain this properly but it appears to be ""growing a special list"" and it grows `targetHarm` from 1 to the original input size.
Taking a blind leap I would now write the following based on the idea that we will loop from `1` to `targetHarm`.


    def sawFull(list,targetHarm):
        result = makeSine(list,1) # default case at 1
        for i in range(2, targetHarm + 1): # If we had targetHarm = 1 we would skip over the loop which is there to handle recursion
            return([x + y for x, y in zip_longest(sawFull(list,targetHarm-1),makeSine(list,targetHarm),fillvalue=0)])
        return result

Now the above should return the same result but be slower than what we started with.
But it looks closer to what we want.


    def sawFull(list,targetHarm):
        result = makeSine(list,1) # default case at 1
        for i in range(2, targetHarm + 1): # If we had targetHarm = 1 we would skip over the loop which is there to handle recursion
            result = [x + y for x, y in zip_longest(sawFull(list,targetHarm-1),makeSine(list,targetHarm),fillvalue=0)]
        return result

closer still

    def sawFull(list,targetHarm):
        result = makeSine(list,1) # default case at 1
        for i in range(2, targetHarm + 1): # If we had targetHarm = 1 we would skip over the loop which is there to handle recursion
            # i takes the role of the  `targetHarm` we would recurse to.
            result = [x + y for x, y in zip_longest(sawFull(list,i-1),makeSine(list,i),fillvalue=0)]
        return result

Closer still (now let's replace the recursive call to `sawFull` with the previous `result` which lines up to `sawFull(list, i-1)`).


    def sawFull(list,targetHarm):
        result = makeSine(list,1) # default case at 1
        for i in range(2, targetHarm + 1): # If we had targetHarm = 1 we would skip over the loop which is there to handle recursion
            # i takes the role of the  `targetHarm` we would recurse to.
            result = [x + y for x, y in zip_longest(result, makeSine(list,i), fillvalue=0)]
        return result

Now we don't have any recursion left.

2020-06-25 01:26:28,Priestly_Adejo,"Thank you for the in depth review of the small program.

 You see, I was planning to make use of functions like in my last program (see my other posts), but this time around I decided not to because I was coding as I thought. I accept that what I should've done is to plan out my work beforehand (in the form of notes and flow charts).

Next, concerning the functions, I was thinking of putting them in a class in python then calling them from said class. I could have shortened the length of my code greatly, but I didn't really want to have such large classes folder as I knew I was going to be sharing it online. This would have meant that if someone were to check it there would be a risk of it breaking.

I was also planning to use inheritance within the class as well, but as mentioned above, this would just make it harder to set up the code for people wanting to read it. For example, what if they didn't have the latest python or some of the libraries I installed (although not in this case), weren't on their system?

That being said thank you for reviewing my program, I need to revise try and except again and classes. I will leave the loop unctions untouched but will make functions of their contents.  (The only problem is that my uni entry exams are in the next 2 weeks. I won't have much time.)

You could do this by making an array of size (2,2,2,2) (a 2x2 array of 2x2 arrays). Then you can use a simple `x==0` to find all the points of x that need to be replaced and use that to insert np.array([[1,-1],[-1,-1]])) at the right place in the new array. Then just transpose and reshape the array at the end. This will be the best way from a efficiency point of view.

Another solution is to make a new array of size (4,4) and use a nested loop to loop through x and make the correct slice notation to insert into the new array. This will be the best way from a easy code / code readability point of view."

In my experience, I find that the best way to solidify what I'm learning is to apply it to a personal project or an example that matters to me. Individual practice problems can be helpful to experiment with a concept in isolation, but I always learn more by translating a practice problem/code example to a context that's relevant to my own interests. It inevitably leads to other challenges and mistakes, but those were also the times when I grew my skills the most.

Who recommended that?

It doesn't do the same thing. data\['commands'\] is not a string. In the json, it is an array. In python the json module uses a list to represent the json array.

You can't directly check whether a list is in a string because that doesn't make sense. The string module requires that you only check whether strings are in the string.

You need to check each item in the list individually. So is it only success if all the commands are in the string? Or is it success if any of the commands are in the string?

Edit: Ok, I see from another part of this post that you  meant it the other way around and wanted to see if the string was in the list."

I mean, you are going to have to show specifics; things like this cannot be easily debugged, by a third party, with vague descriptions.  It'll require actual verbatim outputs, tracebacks, etc. to be posted.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;While this runs the QMK CLI, it returns an error saying I needed to install Python 3.6 or greater

This sounds like a path problem, which is not uncommon.  You may be able to test by always providing a full path to the command you are trying to run, to at least see if it's finding the right Python, or finding Python at all, etc.  Also, it may matter (if your ""shebang"" line isn't correct), launching Python directly (with full path) and supplying the script you want to run as an argument.

&amp;#x200B;

But, if what you are running is a Python script, can you not just run the code by importing a module and running it that way?  The following link suggest that it's at least possible:

2020-06-24 23:31:11,ka-splam,"&gt; with set_attribute my intention was that i can after creating a instance, add new attributes to it . i dont know what obj.attr or thing like __setattr__ exist

I mean, Python is so dynamic you just can add new attributes to things by default, without doing anything special, e.g.:

    class Node:
      def __init__(self):
        print(""hi"")


    some_node = Node()

    # here, adding a new attribute:
    some_node.my_new_attribute = ""A Value""

    print(some_node.my_new_attribute)

You have to go to extra effort to forbid this, even. 

There are mechanisms like `__setattr__()` to intercept new attributes so you have more control, can do extra work at the same time, log them, block them, etc. e.g.

    class Node:
      def __init__(self):
        print(""hi"")

      # Triggered when an attribute is added or updated.
      def __setattr__(self, name, value):
        print(f""Wait up, stop adding new attributes like {name}!"")
        
    some_node = Node()
    some_node.my_new_attribute = ""A Value""
    print(some_node.my_new_attribute)

Run that and see the message and the error. Now the attempt to add an attribute has been blocked.

This is part of Python's design where everything is very flexible and dynamic, so when seeing your original code with `set_attribute` avoiding the normal way Python works but doing something very similar, ideally you'd put a comment explaining why you were doing something different.

If it's a matter of ""I didn't know"" then that happens all the time, but being optimistic and assuming the author of some code knows what they're doing and has found some useful reason for going against the normal ways any other Python programmer would reach for - like it's required for XYZ, it works better with our test suite, it's faster, it uses less memory, etc. - then a comment hinting at that reason could be a good comment.

So then the reader assumes that if there's no comment, the author must not know much about Python, jumps in and rewrites it ""better"" because I'm an idiot, and *then* sometimes falls straight into whatever problem or trap the author knew about, was avoiding, but didn't comment on to inform others. 🤷‍♂️

&gt; and the set depth method was written earlier before i knew how to iteratively traverse a tree, ill change that.

No need to change it, recursion is cool and makes for clean, short code. Changing it to iterative might end up faster or able to handle deeper trees, although not necessarily. Just mixing recursive and iterative makes the reader wonder why and a comment might be a place to note why. :)

    import numpy as np
    
    x = np.array([[1,2], 
                  [3,4]])
    y = np.array([[5,6],

Kinda similar to how there are different ways to format a string in python.

Monkeypatching in pytest is just an implementation of monkey patching, the concept. Mocking is also an implementation of monkey patching, with additional concepts like ""Mock"" objects to help you more easily monkey patch stuff with an explicit goal of being able to test your code better.

Pytest doesn't have a ""mock"" afaik, but the standard library in Python 3.x *does* have a mock library. Because all it does is monkey patch things underneath, it's usable with pytest. You can use mocks anywhere and with any library, even in live code--it just doesn't usually make sense to do so.

Zen of python comes to mind:

Otherwise, no, there's no rules or guidelines really. You're on your own to decide what's best for your project. Many python builtins use one or the other or both. For example to make an integer python uses the normal constructor for all conversion types and a classmethod for casting: 

    &gt;&gt;&gt; int(""4"") # convert from string
    4
    &gt;&gt;&gt; int(b""4"") # convert from bytes

2020-06-24 23:03:27,deapee,"Technically, using the standard CPython implementation, your code is bound by the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) - so with threading, your code will not execute concurrently. With certain tasks, such as network waits, etc, this is fine, and with other implementations, such as Jython, code execution is not limited by the GIL. 

So no, threads are not ‘fake’ in python, but they may not be doing what you think they are - executing code entirely separate from each other. 

Of course to get around this in CPython, you can use the multiprocessing module - where each process spawned will have its own GIL.

This is due to many reasons, the biggest being the famously infamous GIL. Searching for that will give you many in depth discussions about this. 

It's important to note that this only applies to atomic python operations, so a C library like numpy can easily get around this. Also note that you can use the `multiprocessing` module and similar to spin up multiple instances of python and work around this."

2020-06-24 22:53:28,TehNolz,"Depends. If you're goal is just to learn new things, then it'll be better to do everything yourself. Libraries often do a lot of the heavy lifting for you, so you won't really know what happens behind the scenes. Building your own library will require you to learn exactly how a specific task is done, which will teach you way more than using a library would. Though it'll also be considerably more complicated depending on what you're doing.  
  
But on the other hand, you'd be reinventing the wheel. Your version of the program will very likely be vastly inferior to whatever popular libraries are out there. This is far from ideal if you're planning on building something that you want others to use, especially in a business environment. Though if this is just a hobby project that you don't intend to share, it'll probably be fine.

That seemed to give me what you are looking for, although at certain times I did get locations that were further away than the limit I put in. This might be a limation with the API in how it is calculating what is in the radius location search and what is not.

2020-06-24 22:33:14,mikeydoodah,"I think the problem you're having is that when you parse the json file it returns a complex hierarchy of different collection types (depending on the structure of your json).

You'll get a mixture of dictionaries and lists (for named json objects and json arrays), and these are no longer strings (and can't be checked against your input string).

It looks like data\['commands'\] is a list, so I'm guessing that your json file contains an array named commands.

Now I don't know what commands contains. Does it contain single values, or does it contain complex json objects?

You /might/ be able to check each item individually:

    for item in data['commands']:
        if str(item) in u_input:
            print(""{item} was in the string"".format(item=item))

A tool like this helps understand your json...

[https://jsoneditoronline.org/](https://jsoneditoronline.org/)

But what. you're doing is converting one FUNDAMENTAL format into FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FORMAT... JSON to SQL.

Because I was only dealing with 400,000 records I decided to look into saving json into a more similar database format...

Why not save it to TinyDB (which is great) and then work with that?

[https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) All your data ends in one big .json file.

...so you can dump your JSON there, and spend time writing queries that maybe give you csv-like data... like  

def select\_all\_users():  
\#do some TinyDB code here  
\# save\_as\_csv( data )

You can then, EASILY load csv into SQLite etc.

When learning on your own, blockers like that can really kill your momentum and motivation, and figuring out what's worth practicing is a challenge since you're learning so you essentially have no idea what you're doing.

I still have books from all those classes, but I almost never opened them, so that was probably a waste since I could have just gone to the library the few times I actually needed a book for something.

I don't think YouTube clips are likely to help much with just basic coding. I've tried watching some, but I have never found it at all more helpful to watch someone code than to just read what they've written at the end. The added commentary tends to be mostly obvious and the rest borders on useless with the occasional interesting point, but just trying to code the same thing yourself is probably going to get you farther and it'll take about as long. When talking about algorithms and the math behind them, it's a different story, and YouTube can have some very-interesting content (like, just about everything by 3B1B).

&gt; How long did it take you to feel competent and to feel like ""I KNOW python."" ?

A month or two, but it was far from my first programming language, and I mostly used it with NumPy, so a lot carried over from Matlab which I knew very well.

&gt; The reason I ask is because I am 23 and I feel like the ship has sailed. I'm sure a lot of people might be in a similar situation to me.

No, you can learn it. At your age, I did a master's program with a bunch of people who couldn't code at the start, and within six months they were writing high-performance simulators in C that were running on 160-core clusters. Admittedly, their stuff was messier and generally worse than what those of us who'd learned programming beforehand could write, but it worked and ran fast and they got there in just a few months. If you're going to do it on your own, though, just be aware that it'll take longer and you'll need to somehow keep yourself motivated which is really hard when you get stuck and have no one to go to."

The only difference is when you do everything, hashing and all, on the server side you assure the password is salted and hashed the way you want it.

So the proper way for the most part to do it is to send a POST request to the server over HTTPS and then have server generate a salt to add to the given password and then hash that result and then save the salt as well as the password for future validation when the user logs back in.

Both can work but one way is the way you should do it and that way is have the server handle the salting and hashing and validation of all inputs"

2020-06-24 21:21:49,Atlantis_One,"Beginner myself, so cannot garantue everything I say is correct. But your program is what I have learned is called a 'monolithic' program, where it is just one big block of code. There are two main techniques on how to improve this, splitting it up into functions (functional decomposition) and using classes (can't remember the name). However, even when using classes, one of the main possibilites is using methods, which are a basically a function as well, only connected to a specific object.

This part is the hard part, but you should see what makes sense in your case.

I would suggest functional decomposition, since it is a bit easier for beginners and makes more sense to me in this scope. Using classes could be an option as wel though.

So for functional decomposition you split the code up into functions. For example your try-except statement: as you say in your comments, the except never gets triggered because you already have several if-statements in it. But you could take that piece of code and put it in a function like 'show\_rules' or something, that you can just call there. That increases the readability of the code a lot but also helps if you want to show the rules at a different place (re-usability). You can do the same for the part where you start up, the part where you ask the questions, the part where you ask to play again and the part where you end the game.. That gives you three main parts which can be recalled all the time if necessary. You can further split it up if that makes sense. But structure might look something like this:

    def start_up()
        ...
    
    def show_rules()
        ...
    
    def ask_question()
        ...
    
    def ask_replay()
        ...
    
    def end_game()
        ...
    
    play = True
    
    start_up()
    show_rules()
    
    while play:
        for question in questions:
            ask_question(question)
        play = ask_replay()
    
    end_game()

This solve the replay problem and makes it very clear what the program is doing. Then if I wonder how you actually show the rules, I can check out that function.

Another thing to point out is that it could be even further put into functions, for example the looping over the questions could be put into a `ask_questions` function (using the already defined `ask_question`. Also see that I don't use hardcoded values like `range(1,6)` since I might add or remove questions in the future, which would break this code.

I am not as experienced with implementing classes unfortunely, but in this case you could implement different players that have different choices, all being an instance of `class Player`. For the current gameplay, maybe you can create a `class Question` that have attributes for the different options and for the right answer, instead of having to make an array with questions and another with answer and one with options. This way you can also add new questions easier without having to replace all the previously mentioned lists and arrays.

Then some small UX (user experience) comments: I found the waiting time to be on the longer side and the prompt got cluttered quickly by all the printed lines with whitelines between them. So maybe shorten it a bit and print them without a whiteline after every second. I also noticed the remaining seconds counted up, so 1 second left, 2 seconds left etc. I assume you wanted that the other way around?

Long comment, but hopefully you can use it to improve yourself. Also I think the idea is nice, I thought the quiz was funny and the important part of learning of just doing it, so good job on that!

Edit: so I played around a little bit more to see if I could break it. I had one additional remark: if you put in something that is not one of the options (a, b and c), it gets caught it a loop with saying my answer is not valid. This is because you don't actually assign the value of the input to the variable `letteranswer`, so the program sticks with the first invalid answer."

            if key == 1:

I've also learnt and enjoyed myself 100x more since I did two things; I stopped worrying about my ability vs others and just got down and programmed things I wanted to (try to) and more importantly I started to learn from the people who are better than me rather than be intimidated by them.

Don't think about yourself/other people just think about the physical programming :)"

2020-06-24 20:40:36,DandyHOBBO,"Okay I understand what you are asking now. 

So the big thing is HTTPS. HTTPS uses singed keys to secure data including all post requests like passwords, usernames, a chat message etc. Whatever it is, if you use HTTPS it gets secured using that key.

Since we are using HTTPS we know our information is secure since it is encrypted before it gets sent. This is done using private and public keys from the server and you. 

So a man in the middle attack, or where you simply see the information being sent from the client to the server, is hard to read because of encryption from HTTPS. 

You could totally spam the server with a bunch of passwords and see if one sticks. You could guess the password that way. 

But if your asking which is better then salting and hashing on the server is better. If your hashing on the client side then you run into the risk of the client changing the hash or salt and such. If you do it on the server you can guarantee that the info is dealt with securely.


Either way is “secure” but one way assures consistency. 

Also HTTPS checks to see if the site is actually the site you want to visit. For example when you go to “google.com” your browser knows it’s actually google because they have a valid certificate. This prevents someone from spoofing a site domain and such"

&gt; The way you wrote your code, you have to work with lots of function parameters and return values. You could try to simplify that and at the same time learn something about OOP.
&gt; 
&gt; - introduce a class named user
&gt; 
&gt; - user has properties like wins, symbol, ...
&gt; 
&gt; - create two instances of class user (player and bot)
&gt; 
&gt; - by passing those two objects (e.g. `func(player, bot)`) you can directly access the properties (using e.g. `player.wins`) which might reduce the amount of return values and function parameters
&gt; 
&gt; - maybe expand it even more and create the game board as an object of a class, which has all 9 spaces as properties additionally to generic ones like turn

Ahhh yea ok... I only just came across classes a few days ago, and initially didn't see how to use them... I think this makes sense now. I can pass the whole 'user' object with a function, and all its properties go with it...

Just so you know about my initial question I was asking which version of python you were using to run your program. In certain systems you’ll have python2 and python3. By default when you run python “name of your file.py” it should choose the python3 version of python. 

Now when using pip install “name of a package” and you have python2 installed it will install the package for python2. So to install a package for python3 you must run pip3 install “name of a package”.

Now as you can see when you type in python file.py that the python3 may not have the package installed. Hence no module found with that name. 

Usually the culprit is that you used pip instead of pip3 to install a package."

I'm doing an exercise where I'm given a list *x* and I have to return the same list but without duplicates.

So, this works:

    l=[]

A slightly more advanced idea (just some brainstorming):

The way you wrote your code, you have to work with lots of function parameters and return values. You could try to simplify that and at the same time learn something about OOP.

- introduce a class named user

- user has properties like wins, symbol, ...

- create two instances of class user (player and bot)

- by passing those two objects (e.g. `func(player, bot)`) you can directly access the properties (using e.g. `player.wins`) which might reduce the amount of return values and function parameters

- maybe expand it even more and create the game board as an object of a class, which has all 9 spaces as properties additionally to generic ones like turn"

One way to think of what they do is *reduce adjacency* - if you had a copy of the Gettysburg Address, you might not notice if I snuck in and changed one letter of one word somewhere in the middle. The modified and unmodified text of the address are so close (adjacent) to each other that you might mistake them for each other.

That's completely wrong. `readlines()` *does* read the entire file, it just reads into a list rather than a string, therefore uses slightly more memory than `read()`. 

To be memory efficient you would loop over the file object itself, like this:

You'll get `NaN` values for the records in the larger dataframe that don't exist in the smaller dataframe. Drop the rows where every element is `NaN` and then compare the number of records in this resulting dataframe to the number of records in the smaller dataframe. If they match then the smaller dataframe is contained entirely in the larger one.

You could also use the data class to hold other things, such as the window size, font name and size, standard locations for graphic elements, etc."

Then, assuming there's no missing pixels I would order your dataframe by `x` and `y` columns, then determine the x and y dimensions of your image from their maximum values if you don't already have this information.

Then create a numpy array from your `intensity` values, and reshape it to your x and y dimensions. You might have to transpose this to match your image axis origin."

2020-06-24 16:32:35,DandyHOBBO,"I would say Django is the best way to start. As far as hosting the site? You could use AWS, Microsoft azure, Digital Ocean and others. 

I know Azure and Digital Ocean both give you a credit to try their services out and you pay by use with a cap for the month. So if you wanted you could spin up a server and try everything out for a around dollar or pay five bucks for the month. 

As far as deploying your site you could try this guide: [Deploy Django using Nginx and Gunicorn](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu-16-04). 

If you want to get your own domain, with your name for example, I would simply use google domains. They make it fairly easy. Then you would have to make sure your domain name, website name, points to your server. Digital Ocean has a guide for that too: [Nameservers](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-point-to-digitalocean-nameservers-from-common-domain-registrars).

I personally have used Digital Ocean for a good year, almost two, and have had no issues with their droplets, databases, and other tools. I personally recommend them because it works and it’s affordable. And as you can tell they have some good guides on getting things going and started.

Now to host your scripts and such you could build some nice webpages that describe your scrips and such and link them to a GitHub repo.

Also plenty of guides are on YouTube on using Django and the documentation might seem much but is very useful and very well laid out and written. Following the Django starter guide is wordy but does a good job on how to get started.

As far as auth, you want to look at things like [PassLib](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Never store the password as plain text. Salt and use PassLib to store passwords, but Django also has a way for Auth so use that if you don’t want dive into any of that."

When you learn some more soup and python, amazon will be easier to tackle. I'd imagine how complex it is requires complex coding to cover the complexity, but it's not necessary. For instance, like I mentioned the link needs to be up to date, another way to do what you're doing without checking to see if the link is live would be to program python to search the term you're looking for on Amazon's front page that never changes the link. You won't need an up to date link because you're getting an up to date search on the term you're looking for, then you can figure out how to get the first item in the search or whatever information you're looking for.

Is it important to note that I'm getting two ""cannot access the file"" exceptions?

Oh yeah, I think I just realized. One exception says that it couldn't rename the file (pointing at the ""targetname"" command in the ffmpeg trim command, I think) because of the command that moves the file (shutil.move), then it says that during the handling of that exception, another occurred. That one says it couldn't delete the file (pointing at the fact that by moving a file they copy and then delete it) because a process is accessing the file. That seems kinda crucial. I'll post the actual error just in case I missed more stuff...

    The system cannot find the file specified: 'Duplicates' 

So that means it is most likely a directory. 

Next, you have multiple redundancies. os.listdir returns a list so you don't need to do anything further. If it were an iterable you wanted to unpack to a list you would just pass it to the list constructor instead of using a comprehension. Then later on you sort the list in place and then again on the following line with sorted. 

Finally, what is `x[:32]`? Why up to the first 32 chars? What does that represent? What are you hoping to accomplish?"

2020-06-24 14:02:07,MeteoriteImpact,"Very new to using python for text. I made a simple recommendation system that is completely cold using no user data using only category features herotype, spells and weapons and the characters name.

Looking to bring more life into the recommendations.

It just runs get_dummies and converts to 0/1
And gives the results with highest score 1.0 exact match and sorts descending. 

Now on to the question I also have a background story which 3-5 sentences for each character.

Besides or adding ontothese two ideas any suggestions or tips on things I can do with the text to get more clustered or grouped, scores information from three sentences. To add into the mix.

1. I want to get the text similarity. 

It works fine but I also have character biographies. I am now thinking about doing similarity to get characters with similar backgrounds story. It could also may classify by location mentioned in bios but maybe just having it lump into 4 or 6 groups is fine.

3. Some characters should be good and some bad was also thinking of running sentiment analysis I know the biographies have things about helping or not and each word has a score just wonder if hero have positive content or negative content. I also assume there could be negative hero’s and positive bad guys. So that could possibly be add to it.

I am hoping these two changes will bring more life into the recommender."

2020-06-24 13:33:56,MikeTheWatchGuy,"&gt; I would like to do something more useful or something that is not a game to gain motivation, where should I look? 

I'm a big believer in the ""build-shit"" method for learning programming as well as getting motivation.  As u/MyNamesNotReallyDave has already mentioned, [PySimpleGUI](http://www.PySimpleGUI.org) is good to get started with GUIs.

I am constantly building new tools to help me in my daily computing life using PySimpleGUI.  Yesterday I wrote a little launcher that runs on my desktop that will open some .py files in PyCharm that I edit a lot.  Rather than scrolling around in PyCharm and finding the file I want to edit, I click a button on my desktop and it opens PyCharm to edit that file.  It's a tiny little utility that is saving me loads of time.

I recommend making something you'll use and make it with PySimpleGUI.  Look through the MANY [demo programs](http://Demos.PySimpleGUI.org).  I like to know what's happening on my PC, so I run a lot of the   
""Desktop Widgets"" that you'll find in that folder.  Use these demos as ""patterns"" to get you a head-start.  Then modify them to suit your needs. 

To get started, just download and run some.  Get used to being successful at running these little GUIs until you get the courage up to modify one or build one yourself.

I find these little ""helper"" programs to be a perpetual motion motivator machine - make a tiny little program quickly that works and it's so useful that you use it a LOT, which will naturally motivate you to make another, etc.  

The key to this build-it strategy is to make the projects short enough that you experience the feeling of ""accomplishment"".  This is highly important.  Set the bar too high and you'll get to experience the feeling of ""failure"", a not very helpful emotion when you're trying to be more motivated.  Programmers are in a unique position to build their own tools.  

PySimpleGUI enables Python programmers at all levels to be able to make a tool with a GUI front-end with very little training needed and the code tends to be very short.  If you like learning from videos, a new ""2020 series"" has been created that will get you up to speed quickly. http://YouTube.PySimpleGUI.org"

If you want to find the `QUANTITY` values where `DESCRIPTION` is `a`, you can use:

    df.loc[df['DESCRIPTION'] == 'a', 'QUANTITY']

This returns a Series, and as there is more than one row that has a description of `a` you get multiple values returned. If you want to do it from your groupby expression where `DESCRIPTION` is now the index, you can simply use:

    g = df.groupby('DESCRIPTION')['QUANTITY'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)
    
    g['b'] # gives the value at index 'b'

`hist = {}` 

Dict definition. One of the fundamental datatypes in python (have a look at the python docs for the others such as lists and tuples).

`zip(x,y)`

An iterator that iterates through the shortest of the iterables in the arguments. In this case x and y are the same length and they are just iterating through it (see python docs for more info).

`hist[xi] = hist.get(xi, 0) + yi`

I am doing an assignment (`hist[xi]`) but doing it in a way where first I try to see if the key is in the dict:  
\- If the key is found get returns the value to the key

\- else it returns the default argument (0 in this case)

&amp;#x200B;

So what I am doing is retrieving the value (initially zero) and then adding the value of yi to it. This means that hist gets filled it would see 5 as a key with value 10, then as it sees 5 again as key it adds 15 (you print statements to verify this).

The plotting stuff is just using the operators on the dict, i.e. the x values are the keys and the y values are the values of the dict. Remember that a dict is just a mapping between keys and values.

2020-06-24 12:21:07,NFLAddict,"Well, where you do you write code? you must be running it somewhere?  
Regarding your program: 
I just assumed the indentation, but it might be incorrect. I assumed everything was inside the while loop.   
The thing is, you are checking if either has 3 points, before the rest of the code has been evaluated. so by the time the increment happens, the loop finishes, but because the check is done at the top, it has to run again, to be checked, but running another iteration results in yet another input prompt. 
 if you move those code blocks, to the bottom like below, that will fix the issue. 
  
        if UserPoint == 3:
            GameOver = True
            print(""You have won the game!"")

        elif ComputerPoint == 3:
            GameOver = True
            print(""You have lost the game."")

        elif User_Input == ""Exit"":
            print(""Closing the game..."")
            IsTrue = False

        if GameOver == True:
            print(""The game is over, a winner has been decided."")

But more importantly. Just a couple comments.  
I don't know how much you have learned, but using `break` would be very useful, especially when combined with `while True`. its a very important concept to learn, so I may as well explain it now. The idea is that your loop will keep running, until some condition is met, that results in  `break` : this keyword means the loop will instantly terminate. think of it as 'breaking' out of the loop.   
Additionally, one of the most important principles of coding is not being repetitive. I wont complicate things by talking about functions are things you may not know about, but just look at your code. You could easily, have one line at the bottom of the loop, that prints out the computer choice, and another line that says the score. and the if else blocks are just there to update the count of user or computer. there's no need to keep repeating the lines.  
as an example: here is a way to really shorten your code 
to recap: `break` will instantly terminate the loop. there's one more word that's very useful in loops and its `continue`.  continue - you can think of it telling the program 'continue on to the next loop iteration` and nothing 'under' it will be evaluated as it just immediately jumps to the top of the loop

The correct solution is to not confuse a default *value* with default *functionality*. Functionality is done inside the body, so place it there. What's the ultimate placeholder a default value without risking the issue mentioned above? `None`.

This method works because op is appending both the found factor and the result of dividing the number you are finding factors of by the found factor. 

Integers are often divisible by numbers bigger than their square roots. For example, the square root of 100 is 10. 100 has the following divisors bigger than 10: 20, 25, 50, 100.

If you consider factor pairs, eg for 100: 
1 x 100, 2 x 50, 4 x 25, 5 x 20, 10 x 10. 
You can see that every pair has one figure greater than or equal to the sqrt(100) and one figure less than or equal to it.
Hence, you can just find the factors less than or equal to sqrt(x) and then find the rest by dividing x by each small factor."

As the random French bloke you meet once in a while, I couldn't help but check your google translations so they are accurate. (bc you know, that's important too). Here is a detailed list of what I have for you. (I'm also explaining why I'd change it, for whoever is interested...)

* Line 10, you write ""le ramener à Pluton"". That's okay, though a more conventional translation would be ""le ramener sur Pluton"" (Pluto being a planet-ish, the objective tends to be to be on it)

* Line 11, you write ""Trouver ...."", and I think it's because your original sentence was ""Find ...."". Google is bad at this specific thing, it writes the infinitive of the verb in return (as if you entered ""To find .....""). What is expected is ""Trouve .."" : the imperative tense.

* list4_ans[0] == list4_ans[2]

* list6_ans[5] simply doesn't exist as a word. A typo maybe ?

* You have list6_ans[6] == ""chatte"". It is correct. However, just so you know, it means 'a female cat', and idk about you but when I see a cat I assume it's a mister cat. I wouldn't think of this word if I was doing such an exercise, I would think of ""chat"" instead. (ie, 🐈 as a species). Also chances are your kid doesn't know this but ""chatte"" also means 'kitty' in the 18+ meaning of the word. Probably isn't an issue, but yknow

* Line 65, a small typo probably : you basically write ""fusée rechargée 70%"". That translates to ""rocket reloaded 70%"". What is missing is an 'at' in the English version (I think ?). Likewise, the French version should be ""fusée rechargée à 70%""

* Line 73 : I'm assuming the rocket really isn't called ""Rocket"". If it actually is, don't mind this :p If not, then what is expected is ""La fusée est prête"" : 'the rocket is ready'

* Line 74, totally a typo : it's not ""mercie"" but ""merci""

*Line 77 : you write ""Ne quittez pas"" and I imagine you meant ""don't give up"". What Google wrote is ""do not quit"" as people would tell you to wait when you make a phone call (in proper telemarketing English that would be ""please stay on hold""). The correct translation is ""N'abandonnez pas"". (It would be ""N'abandonne pas"" if the President is close to the player, but here he most likely isn't)

That's it ! Thanks for bearing with me, I really wanted to make sure your kid doesn't learn Google's broken French. It's a complicated language for sure, and mistakes aren't easy to correct when you get used to saying them. Wish him/her good luck for me ! ;)"

Generate a UUID when the password is entered, this is your salt.

You might want to write a function that changes the amount of white space in the string depending on whether or not it’s odd or even. I think that might do the trick. There could be a smarter solution but that’s what I got! I used 3 spaces for even length strings and 4 for odd length strings.

It might not be the best solution but it should work. Also, try to avoid python classes as variable names, str in your example."

If you want equal space both before and after the ""Text"", to make it centered, just use spaces.  If you want to do fancier formatting for columns, with fixed column locations, but still have centered text, you'll need to use fancier string formatting constructs than just appending strings.

You can [read JSON](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_json.html) and then dump it to a flat file to upload into your database or [write it directly to your database.](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_sql.html)
2020-06-24 08:57:09,bp200991,"Ok, thanks. If I understand correctly I think the following will help. Firstly, if `scanned_items` is a list that contains the codes as you say, you need to count them up.  Look into using a counter for this; you can see the documentation [here.](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/collections.html#collections.Counter) You can pass your `scanned_items` list to the counter and it will return a counter object (which is essentially a dictionary) where the key is the UPC and the value is the count.

Now you need to get this into your dataframe. Look into the `Series.map` method, which you can use to map the values of a dictionary based on the key. Your UPC column should match the keys in the counter object, so (assuming your counter object is named `c`), you can simply:

     df['Count'] = df['UPC'].map(c)

What is the problem that interests you? Simulating insect nervous systems? Environmental simulations of Arctic ice sheets? Finding the optimum racing line around a race track? What is a problem space that interests you? Find THAT topic then work backwards. Determine which approach might be useful. Keep working backwards. How could you solve a little part of that approach using Python? Break that down even further. What's an example of a function you might need? Start writing that function.

If you're motivated by the problem space, it'll pull you through the coding skills required to get there.

2020-06-24 08:14:33,jiri-n,"In early nineties, I wrote a program (in pascal or C, I don't remeber it after so many years ;-)) which served to a similar purpose. 

&amp;#x200B;

I still believe this method has some benefits compared to learn vocabulary from a book. The main thing is that people tend to remember which text was at which position on a page so they filter out wrong answers in a very efficient way. Of course, they then do not remember the vocabulary.

If printed on a screen, each word is at an exactly same position which 1) doesn't allow brain to remember positions 2) allowing it to remember what's necessarry.

Furthermore, program can switch between translation from user's native language to a foreign one and vice versa dynamically to improve user's ability to use the foreign language.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, however, I wouldn't choose CLI as a proper UI. I would choose a web interface to allow users to use my great vocabulary-training application on mobile device thus learning anywhere.

And it would move youre source code and the data away from your son so that he couldn't cheat (as easily). ;-)

This of course doesn't disqualify python from the game. There are libraries and frameworks which support such types of applications. (flask, django to name the most famous)"

In the first one: um... yeah? Obviously, that’s what that code does. The code’s straightforward enough that the comment actually makes it *harder* to read (partially because of the convention that comments are supposed to add information).

The second one illustrates the principle that you often shouldn’t comment *what* the code does, but rather *why* the code does the thing in that way."

if this String != this Tuple:

print invalid input

And the reason it still continued to tell you if you won or lost the rounds after spitting out invalid input, its because you have your game mechanics in a separate conditional statement than your invalid input, so even though that's triggering before anything else, it still runs through your lower conditional.

2020-06-24 06:49:04,Protoss_Pylon,"Hooray! I can finally answer a question about SSL :D

 You can use the `cacerts` by telling your friend to make you a  certificate package with the root certificate inside it. NOT the private key, mind you, but the certificate that signed the CSR that made the server's certificate. Put it into a PEM file and put the file in your script's working directory. If there was more than one certificate in the signing process, remember to put them in order in which they were signed, with the root certificate on the bottom. 


Alternatively, you can use fingerprints instead of the ""PKI"". To do this,  start by creating an empty ssl context:

    ctx = ssl.SSLContext()
  
And that's it actually; you can connect to anything using SSl with that, buuuuuuut it's not that secure. Next step is tell it which ciphers to use so a malicious server doesn't trick you into using old crappy ciphers. 
 
    excellent_ciphers = [d for d in c.get_ciphers() if not ('SSL' in d['protocol'] or 'TLSv1.0' in d['protocol'])]
    c.set_ciphers(' '.join(excellent_ciphers))

yay all secure mathmatically, but without a PKI, oh noooo how will you secure your implementation and verify your server :(((!

Turns out it's really easy! Once you create a connection using the context and get a wrapped socket, you can implement host *fingerprinting*  to prevent MITM attacks by hashing the certificate (obviously):

    import hashlib
    s = ctx.wrap_socket(ssl.create_connection(('www.google.com', 443)))
    fingerprint = hashlib.sha256(s.getpeercert(binary_form=True)).hexdigest()

if you save the fingerprint and reference it whenever you connect, you won't blindly trust self signed certificates yay! 

NOTE: sometimes in a distributed computing environment, different servers with different IP address under the same hostname will have *different* certificates, but they will be signed by the same intermediary certificate and root certificate and are therefore trustworthy. This is all taken care of for you by the `cacerts` mechanism, so, my advice is to get that working."

2020-06-24 06:44:57,captainAwesomePants,"K, first let's format this. You can do that by putting \`\`\` on the line before and after the code, or you can just indent all the code at least 4 spaces. Also, let's remove whatever caused your lines to all get capitalized. Like so:

```
def find_prime_divisor(x):
  divisor = [ ]
  prime = [ ]
  count = 0

  # Find all divisors of x
  for i in range(1,x+1):
    if x % i ==0:
      divisor.append(i)

  # Filter out divisors that are not prime.
  for j in divisor:
    for k in range(1,j):
      if j % k ==0:
        count +=1
    if count == 1 and k not in prime:
      prime.append(k)
      count = 0
    else:
      count = 0
```

Here are your problems:

* Your code doesn't return anything. I'm pretty sure you want to return `prime`, the list you so carefully constructed.
* Your filter section doesn't remove anything. It only adds MORE things. You either want to construct a new list or remove things from the existing list.
* Your filter section adds 1 less than the right number. It should be adding j to the list, but it adds k, which'll be one less than j. So if it decides 5 is prime, it'll add a 4 to the list.

You may find that writing a separate function, `def is_prime(num)`, will make your program easier to debug."

2020-06-24 06:11:25,primitive_screwhead,"&gt;I know calling something like subprocess.call(\[""ls"", ""-l""\]) creates a new process, but what exactly is the process?

'ls'

&amp;#x200B;

The 'ls' command (which lists files on Unix/Linux systems), with '-l' as it's first argument.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Am I running cmd? Python.exe? I'm just really confused and I need some clarification.

You're possibly confusing the ""subprocess"" module with Python's ""multiprocessing"" module?  The ""subprocess"" module literally runs other executables on the system, that don't need to be Python processes.  For example, 'ls' above is a general process on Linux that will list the files in a directory (although Python can do this directly; that's just a simple example).

&amp;#x200B;

However, if you want to launch other Python processes to run your code, to maybe perform work independently, and then return those results to your first Python process (that launched them), then ""multiprocessing"" could be used.  There's a lot under the hood, but it lets your program continue executing while another Python process is started to run other Python code (often a function), which you can then later ""join"" to get the results.  Things like that.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Or am I just confused about what processes even are?

Possibly, I'm not sure of your background.  Did you understand what the 'ls' program was, and have you ever typed it before (ie. do you use Linux, and are you comfortable with the command line?)

&amp;#x200B;

What kind of thing were you hoping to accomplish with the ""subprocess"" module, or were you just practicing?"

Like get periodic returns for various assets classes, calculate expected return and risk/standard deviation, then you plot the 'efficient frontier.. theoretically you can then  construct portfolios in compliance with one finance theory. It's common. It may be interesting to talk about on a resume. And more pragmatically, it could be useful to be familiar with optimization programming, if you add a bunch of constraints.  It may be interesting to go a step further and construct these portfolios and then back test them against different time periods. Back-testing any finance theories or investment strategies could be an interesting exercise and worth a discussion. 

Finance lends itself well to programming/modelling because there's just so much data.

Other concepts to google and read about that may lend themselves to a python project are factor investing and risk-parity.  

Good luck."

    date_time	alarm	duration

It has a learning curve involved to it, but allowing multiple developers to work on the same source code is one of the things it excels at.

The biggest issue is what to do with merge conflicts; if two or more people make changes to the same section of source code, then someone will have to make the decision as to what changes to retain.

2020-06-24 04:09:55,misho88,"Are you just trying to reverse it or add it up recursively? Not that the implementation is going to be much different, but it is an important distinction.

Regardless, if you want every element of a list but the last one, the way to tell Python that is `the_list[:-1]`. You could instead modify the list in place with something like `the_list.pop(-1)` and pass on the modified list instead of `the_list[:-1]`. This is known as a side effect because the function does something more than just returning a value for some given arguments, and when doing this kind of programming, it's generally not a good idea to have side effects, so I suggest avoiding the `list.pop()` method and anything else that changes the original list.

Anyway, just so you have some working code to refer against:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; def rev(a): return a[-1:] + rev(a[:-1]) if a else []
    ... 
    &gt;&gt;&gt; rev([1,2,3,4])

Given my love for sports, interest in sportsbetting, and fantasyfootball, one project I worked on years ago was along the lines of sports predictive analysis.  
  
You can make it as complex as you wish. It could be more on the beginner/intermediate side or more on the advanced side. But at the very least, it would require you to learn a lot of different important principles, and familiarize yourself with some widely used libraries and technologies.   

for one, getting the data. webscraping and using a library like beautifulsoup for example. maybe storing data in a CSV, and learning how to use python to read CSVs.   
once you can get the data, you also need a way to store the data. so learning about databases and SQL is a big plus. certainly very relevant in any dataanalyst type role, and never hurts to learn.

it could definitely be helpful to learn some of more commonly used libraries, like pandas numpy matplotlib (to name a few) to help with actually analyzing the data. If you wanted to delve deeper into datascience and ML, python has some really great libraries as well. 
  
Many people in finance love watching football, and play fantasyfootball; If I was ever interviewing for a finance related position, an overwhelming amount of people were intrigued by the project, even if it didn't exactly parallel the responsibility's of that particular position. (of course, being passionate about football and working on something interesting is only helpful, as when it comes time to discuss it, its only natural to have more confidence talking about something you really enjoy. and confidence is an extremely likeable trait in people)

2020-06-24 02:18:33,NFLAddict,"Very fair question, and I hope these courses don't expect beginner's to be familiar with different concepts in number theory, or more advanced mathematics.
  
But because you're interested:  
You're absolutley right about it being more efficient than looping through every number. This is particularly relevant for very large numbers, (one example, testing whether a 20digit or say a 100digit number is prime)  
  
the basic idea: if you wanted to find all the divisors of a number, you only need to test numbers up to and including the squareroot  (note: line 4 is not correct. range is non inclusive. so it should be `for i in range(1, int(x**.5)+1):`  
  
Let's take 100 as an example: the squareroot is 10. I only have to test the divisibility of numbers up to 10, and I'll still be able to find all divisors. 
Reason: If I have a number bigger than 10. The only way it can possibly divide 100, is if it's 'pair' is less than 10. why?  
well consider what 10 being the squareroot means: 10x10= 100.   
If I multiplied any two numbers, that are both larger than 10, the result has to be larger than 100. (11*11=121). So if one number is larger than 10 and divides 100, its 'pair' must be smaller than 10. for example: 20. 20 x 5. (and 5 is less than 10, the squareroot)  
  
so if we only check the numbers up to 10, that is enough to find all divisors. to illustrate: 
starting at 1.   does 1 divide 100? yes...its other half is 100. 1x100  
2? yes...its other half is 50.
3? no. 
4? yes. its other half is 25.
5? yes. its other half is 20.  
6? no. 7? no. 8? no. 9? no. 10? yes...its the squareroot. 10x10.   
 
 if you're wondering, how do we find these other halfs- by dividing them into the 100 (which is what line 7 is doing in your code)  

hope this helps"

2020-06-24 01:59:27,DominatrixDuck,"Yeah no problem dude. I think the big concept that’s necessary to understand is the file system and path. You can think about it like this: each directory/file is stored in a location under your root directory (e.g. the top most directory). To find a specific file, you need to know the path of that item.

Let's look at a visual example:

    test_folder
    │   script.py
    │
    ├───folder_1
    │       script_2.py
    │       script_3.py
    │
    └───folder_2
            data.csv

In this example, our current directory is `test_folder`, and let's say we want to access the `data.csv` file in order to include it in our [`script.py`](https://script.py) file.

Well let's figure out it's path:

`./folder_2/data.csv` would be the absolute path from our current directory to that csv file. (The period at the beginning meaning our current directory `test_folder`).

So now that we know the path, let's load it into our python script, [`script.py`](https://script.py):

    import pandas as pd
    
    test_df = pd.read_csv('./folder_2/data.csv')
    
    test_df.head()

There we go, now our script has loaded that file into a dataframe. 

Hopefully that clears up the concept of path."
2020-06-24 01:58:37,qelery,"I disagree. Python is so close to English that comments which tell step-by-step what the code does are completely unnecessary. And if comments *are* needed to explain step-by-step what the code does, then the code probably should be re-written.

Examples:

    index += 1  # The index is updates
    
    
    # The node depth is just parent depth + 1
    self.Depth = self.Parent.Depth + 1"

2020-06-24 01:51:49,shiftybyte,"This is more of a math question.

The root of a number is a number that you can multiply by itself and get the original numbers.

so let's say 16 is the number and it's root is 4.

so 4 * 4 is 16...

now if u want to find any other divisor it will have to be other than 4... so let's look at a divisor smaller. let's say 2...

if you decreased the left number, stands to reason the right one in the multiplication needs to increase to get to the same result...

    4 * 4 = 16
    2 * ? = 16

answer is 8... so if the divisor on the left is smaller than root, the matching divisor on the right is bigger than root.

any divisor you find that is smaller than root you'll find a match that is bigger than root, and the other way around.

so it's enough to get all the divisors up to root, and you'll get the higher ones by dividing by the smaller ones."
2020-06-24 01:48:45,qelery,"For me personally, I only write a docstring for large functions or complex functions. Your functions are short, clear, and have descriptive names so they don't need much commenting. But a [docstring](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/) for your `Root` class itself and your longer function `tree_traversal` might be helpful.

Rules I personally try to go by for comments (not necessarily for docstrings):

1. I can assume the person reading my code is at least familiar with the subject at hand, so the comments should take no time to explain the subject at hand. If I do want to explain the subject at hand, I could probably use a Readme file. In your case, a lot of the comments just explain how a tree works. You can assume the person reading your code knows how a tree works.
2. The code should speak for itself / be self documenting. If another person isn't able to see what the code does just be reading the code, then I may have done a poor job writing it.
3. Comments should generally tell *why*, not *how*.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The above is all just opinion, but some of your comments objectively are 100% unnecessary. These examples only clutter things up because what they explain is completely obvious just by looking at the code itself:

    def add_leaf(self, data):
        self.Children.append(Node(data, self))

    self.Depth = self.Parent.Depth + 1

    index += 1  # The index is update
    
    
    
    # Node class is use to make nodes, it inherits the the 
    methods of root but the instance initialisation is changed
    # Node has a Parent, The depth is found using the set_depth method
    class Node(Root):
        def __init__(self, data, parent):

One of the laptops I recently purchased was the Dell XPS 13, and the home/end keys are very awkwardly placed on the keyboard so I swapped them with the pgup/pgdn keys that are located near the arrow keys.

I've created a final, empty column called ""Count"" and I would like it to be a count of how many of each item have actually been scanned upon receipt from the warehouse.

There's a list called 'scanned_items' which is populated with the UPC code of every item that is scanned in. So each 'scan' is added to the list with:
scanned_items.append(scan)

I've tried many variations of code like this:

For row in df:

Say, for example, you're planning a career in architecture. You could code a webscraper that finds new articles about the type of architecture/ design you're interested in and downloads/ blogs them for you.

A good project if you've got a lot of media (hard drive full of downloaded songs etc) could be to write a program to catalogue them all and download album art.

If you're really struggling to find motivation for purely software projects, I'd definitely recommend buying a Raspberry Pi (a Pi Zero Wireless will only set you back about $10 or so) and explore mixing programming with electronics. There are loads of project ideas out there for makers. I recently built and programmed a sprinkler system for my garden that waters 14 pots in my garden and on my balcony. I programmed the Pi to control a series of valves installed under my deck; it measures the soil moisture and waters the plants if they're getting too dry.

Or if it's a mutable object you don't even have to return it, you can change it within the function.

You can also define a class, and have instance variables in the class accessible by functions that use them.

Global variables are generally considered bad because using them creates code dependencies that are hard to track, and it also creates code that is not reusable.

If you make a function that reads one line from an already open file, using global variable to hold the file handle, you cant use that function to read from two files simultaneously without exchanging handles just because the variable name is coded inside the function.

    def line_from_file():
        global fh
        global line
        line = fh.readline()


    fh = open(""file1"")
    line_from_file()
    # now we got the line we want in ""line"", lets add it a line from file 2...
    #fh = open(""file2"") ?? that will overwrite previous fh
    fh2 = open(""file2"") # but now line_from_file doesnt use fh2...
    fh3 = fh
    fh = fh2
    line_from_file() # there, we read a line from the second file...
    # now to add it to the line from the first...
    line = line + line...??? wait, we overwrote line too....

all this mess is solved by arguments and returned values.

2020-06-24 00:08:22,dargscisyhp,"It might help to look at it step by step. A nice way to do this (and perhaps a good way to get familiar with the debugger) is to use the python debugger. Save your program, and then use your terminal to navigate to the folder it is saved in. Then invoke the Python debugger using the following (my example assumes your code is saved as translate.py)

``
python -m pdb translate.py
``

This brings you into the debugger. You should see a (Pdb) prompt. Type 'l' to show you where you are in your code at any time, and s to step through your code. Finally, you can take a look at your variables at any time by typing 

``
pp locals()

I did Python Crash Course as my first book, where you learn to build a simple game among other things. It gives great introductions to all the data types and some other libraries.

Next I started impractical python projects which covers a few classes in itertools and collections (both super handy libraries), this also has an introduction to basic genetic algorithms.

I did a few tutorials on the tech with tim YouTube channel to get to grips with tensorflow and NEAT (at a very basic level), and am in progress coding a snake game that I'll try with both types of neural net.

I'd say don't run before you can walk. Make sure you have a good understanding of the built-ins and know how to break problems down. Keep working on relatively simple projects and build you knowledge. Making games is a good way to use neural nets to learn, I think, but you need to understand how to make games first.

2020-06-24 00:06:24,ka-splam,"&gt; this is a classic case of ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"".

All commenting is, like any writing someone will say it doesn't explain enough and spend enough time on examples, and someone else will say it explains too much and labours over trivial examples. Readers are different.

But with code there's a particular style of ""echo what the code says"" which is almost universally agreed to be low-value to any reader. Especially a language like Python which is so English-Pseudocode like.

(Even then, when posting APL or Regex online, this style of comment helps because most people are unfamiliar and can't read what the code says).

&gt; I honestly wouldn't have imagined people giving you too much crap about your commenting, if you never opened yourself up to criticism about it.

We never would. It's why asking for criticism is a good way to skill up quickly, but also brutal and uncomfortable. Most things are bad, and most of us are happy to leave them that way because they're good enough.

&gt; Plus, when you are deploying your code into production, all of the commenting gets scrubbed out anyways.

? That's not guaranteed. Especially if you're writing comment-based-help or comment-documentation where the comments get turned into production material as well as the code.

&gt; My point is: You're going to get criticized no matter what, so do what is the net-best option, take it on the chin, and move on.

Noooo, take it on the chin and *do better*.  `index = 0  # Reset index to zero` is not a comment style to move on from, it's a comment style to nip in the bud"

As a beginner, if you find yourself reaching for `global` it's generally best to stop, and re-examine the problem (Python has a naming hierarchy known as LEGB - for Local, Enclosing, Global and Built-in) - invoking the `global` declaration promotes your variable by two ranks, which can have unintended consequences and lead to issues if you're not careful. 

That said, this does what you've asked

```
def print_hello(elem):
    global my_name
    my_name = elem
    return my_name

#example usage
print(print_hello('jack'))
print(my_name)

However, it sounds like a really long winded way to write - and achieve the same thing as just writing
`my_name = elem` without declaring a new function.

Once I had the JSON response from Tumblr it was easy to just cycle through the entries and grab the image URLs from any that were photo posts. Then I looped through those image URLs and downloaded to local storage (this was running on a Raspberry Pi on my home LAN).

6. The comment is something like point 3, but sketchy reminders which only make sense to you and nobody else.

There is no perfect comment or amount of commentary, people have different ability in reading code and different knowledge of problems, solutions, data structures, code patters. But almost everyone quickly gets to be able to read code well enough that Type 1 comments add very little value.

Type 5 is the most valuable and least common. Type 1 and 6 are the most common and least valuable.

----

This comment in your code is an example of Type 1:

    # To later independently add new attribute or change value of any attribute
    def set_attribute(self, attribute, data):

Yes, that is what `set_attribute` says.

What I want in the comment is Type 6 - why does this method exist at all, since you never call it? Type 3 - Why are you wrapping `__dict__` like that instead of the usual `obj.attr = data`? and if you are doing something special or unusual, Type 4 - should it be done through `__setattr__`?

----

Similar with ""# this is the Root class;  class Root:""  - I can see that bit. Why have you separated Root and Node? It's part of the recursive beauty of a tree structure that you can cut anywhere and any Node can be a root or leaf.

----

This is a pretty good Type 3 comment:

        stack = []  # Stack will consist of a Node and the index

It's not obvious what you intend to put in this list, and the comment adds some useful explanation.

----

Here, Type 1:

    current, _ = stack.pop()  # The stack top is popped out, index is not needed
    yield current.Data, current.Depth  # yields the value to whatever function that called tree traversal

I know what pop() and yield do, and so do you - every Python programmer does. And if the reader doesn't know what pop() and yield do, these comments don't explain it. And they probably should not explain it, because the middle of a recursive/iterative/generative/object-oriented Tree implementation is no place for a Python tutorial.

----

You have a recursive set_depth() and an iterative tree_traversal() - no Type 6 comments, why are they mixed? Is it just for fun or is it important?"

`IIF` is a function that is specific to Microsoft SQL Server. If you're not using SQL Server, you can't use it. The alternative is to use `CASE WHEN` - which is probably better in any case.

There are two functions in `datetime` that help you with this: `strptime` is used to parse strings into `datetime` objects, and `strftime` is used to format `datetime` objects for output. The code below should explain better than I can.

Machine learning is often used in other types of mineral analysis where the input is understood (radiation emission, chromatography, other chemical and physical analysis etc) and consistent with one or more solid scientific principles. Photographs have a huge amount of variables.

With all that said maybe you do have all the other data, if you knew where the sample was taken from (to compare to known geology), corrected for the parameters of the camera and had a huge dataset of previously human categorised images then it may be possible to create something accurate enough to be useful.

    # This is the Root class, the Root and only the Root of a tree is initialised with Root class

This comment is unnecessary since you already see this in the init method.

    # The root contains by default Depth = 0 and Parent as None

See above.

    # To later independently add new attribute or change value of any attribute
    def set_attribute(self, attribute, data):

The compare the method name and the comment. Your comment is unnecessary.

    # Adds end nodes or leafs which is not a named entity

See above.

    # To add whole another Tree to This Instance(Which is a node of another Tree)
    # The characteristics of the Root of the added tree is changed to behave as a node, but it is still a Root Entity
    # The Parent of the root is changed from None to this Instance    # The depth is initialised to 1 then modified to depend on parent depth    
    def add_tree(self, Tree):    
        Tree.Parent = self    
        Tree.Depth = 1    
        Tree.set_depth()    
        self.Children.append(Tree)

Everything you mention is already understandable from your method name + variables. Also why would you write a comment that you initialize a value to 1 when it's already hard coded there and just a oneliner?

    # Method to set or update the depth of a leaf/Node/Tree and its children if any exists    
    def set_depth(self):    
        # The node depth is just parent depth + 1    
        self.Depth = self.Parent.Depth + 1    
        # The depth of the child nodes are also updated if children exists
        if self.Children:    
            for child in self.Children:
                child.set_depth()

Why this comment? Every comment in this block is just a repetition of the steps inside your function. Your method name is set depth. Also the comment with the depth of the child nodes is trivial.

    # An iterative method to traverse the Tree
    # The traversal is mostly called by other methods such as method : build_depth_dict    
    def tree_traversal(self):    
        current = self # Initial current value is of the Root or the node for which tree traversal  is called    
        stack = []  # Stack will consist of a Node and the index 
        index = 0 # index value determines which child from list is taken, initialised to zero

Why would you write comments about the initial initialization when it's already quite understandable? :O Same as above. The comments are just duplicates and don't provide any information.

And so on...

Tl:dr: Don't write comments for variables like index = 0. These things are kinda obvious and it's super easy to follow what they do. Don't repeat in the comments what your doing in the method. Only write comments for further USEFUL information."

If you're function needs a lot of comments, you might consider to make it shorter, extract functionality or rename your variables. This is one part of refactoring.

It's definitely fine to write doc strings for function arguments and return values or really complicated stuff but use them very rarely.

A lot of comments in a larger project with several developers can be quite confusing because often the code changes but the developer doesn't change the comment or the comment says something different than the code does.

The _number_left is set to the number of tasks expected but is zero by the time it hits the next line for the while loop. So the whole loop gets skipped and it goes back to the main loop of the GUI. If I run the same code without the GUI in the loop the tasks complete as expected."
2020-06-23 21:19:47,cybervegan,"As you've asked for an explainer on modules and namespaces, here you go...

Ok, so each *module* has its own *namespace*, separate from everything else. Everything that's defined in a module's namespace is accessible to client modules (i.e. modules that import it). That goes for functions, classes, and even *variables* and *constants*. There is no ""inheritance"" going on, but nested namespaces (namespaces within other namespaces) can access items in the outer namespaces, so a variable defined in a module's global context (i.e. at the top level) is automatically *visible* within a function defined in that same context, e.g.

```
a = 1

def xyz(abc):
    b = 123
    return a * abc

def zyx(abc):
    c = 345
    return a / abc
```

Here, xyz and zyx have their own namespaces, not visible to the global namespace, but you can refer to objects defined in the outer (global) namespace. You can't refer to xyz's 'b' variable from outside, or within the zyx function, or even from the global context. That is just not allowed. An interesting thing happens when you *redefine* a global variable inside a function - a new, locally visible one gets created, with the same name, but separate from the global one. The new one is said to ""overshadow"" the global one, and you can from that point onwards, only see the local one. This is where the `global` statement comes in - it gets around the overshadowing, and allows you to modify the global value instead. That's why you have to define global variables as global inside your functions, because it changes the way that python goes about finding the variable. 

When you are dealing with modules, you can refer to names inside another module by typing modulename.whatever, and this is the preferred way to access the objects within a module. This works when you have imported the module like this:

    import modulename

But if you do your import like this (the discouraged way), you get a reference to all the objects *in your namespace*:

    from modulename import *

But this might, in fact be what you need to do. It's only discouraged because it *pollutes* your local namespace, and you have to be careful not to overwrite/clash with names you have imported. However, a slightly better version would be:

    from modulename import thing1, thing2, thing3


I think you might be able to get away with putting your definition in a separate module, and instantiate your class instances there; then modules that need them can just import them, and use them directly. If your module is called *automatons*, you could do:

```
# Automatons module
class Automaton()
    ...

automaton_1 = Automaton()
automaton_2 = Automaton()
automaton_3 = Automaton()
```

(I seem to remember you saying that you wanted them all to be the same actual object, so you might have to change the definitions to suit).


And in your client modules:

```
from automatons import automaton_1, automaton_2, automaton_3
```"

2020-06-23 21:01:36,SekstiNii,"I was curious if this would actually be faster than a loop-based approach, so I setup a benchmark and took some measurements. Here is the benchmarked code:

    def f1(a, b):
        return a + np.repeat(b, 10_000)

    def f2(a, b):
        out = a.copy()
        blocks = np.split(out, 1024)
        for i in range(1024):
            blocks[i] += b[i]
        return out

Here is the result of the version from my comment:

    %%timeit
    for row in range(4):
        f1(a[row], b)
    
    199 ms ± 3.11 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
    
And here is a simple loop approach:

    %%timeit
    for row in range(4):
        f2(a[row], b)
    
    83 ms ± 297 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)"
2020-06-23 21:01:29,throwawayvitamin,"I just ran the code on my machine and it works fine. Two things that I could potentially imagine are giving you the error:

1. Are you running Python in the shell? If so, you can only run one line of code at a time, hence the ""multiple statements"" error. Instead of running everything at once, run each line, one by one.
2. Does your indentation match on every line? Python is very whitespace dependent, so make sure it does!"

2020-06-23 20:52:16,heybart,"I'll add to others' comment:

From the programmer's perspective, you need to be aware that you should not count on all the conditions being executed

     if foo(x, y) and bar(z):

If foo(x, y) returns false, then bar will never be called, so that means that  if bar does some other things that you need your program to do regardless whether foo returns true or false, you need to call bar explicitly first

      res = bar(z)
      if  foo(x, y) and res:

The other thing is you'll want to put the simpler conditions first.


      if x &gt;= 5 and x &lt;= 100  and database_search(y):

So if x isn't between 5 and 100 you don't go through the database search.

Edit: so the general idea is even though mathematically a &amp; b is equivalent to b &amp; a, in programming, it is usually not so. So you don't want to do this

     if x.foo() and x is not None:

You want to check if something isn't None first before you try to call one of its functions."

Just like if you built furniture - before you can make an amazing new chair, you need to make a bunch of normal, 4 legged chairs so you can grok all/most of the reasons why they are made that way.

Courses such as edX's *MIT 6.00.1x* (relatively easy) and *Harvard CS50* (challenging) are great. Coursera's *Python for Everyone* is decent and can get you familiar with the syntax. Book like *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* is great. Real Python has a book called *Python Basics*, which is also good.

Put them on your resume whenever you do feel comfortable :) But a general rule of thumb is that you are familiar with basic data structures Python offers (\`list\`, \`dict\`, \`tuple\`, \`set\`), how to write and modularize functions, have a basic understanding of OOP, class, and inheritance, and know a few functional features of Python (list comprehension, map, etc.), understand a few Python built-in features like \`iterators\` and \`generators\`, and know when to use some libraries like \`itertools\`."

Is this just an example? Because you can do that in javascript on the *""client side""* without having to post a form.

There are many ways to do this type of thing but perhaps this example will be useful to you.

    from flask import Flask, request

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def index():
        return '''
            &lt;form onsubmit=""removeA(this.children[0]); return false""&gt;

              &lt;br/&gt;
              &lt;input type=submit value=Remove!&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
            &lt;div id=""output""&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;script&gt;
                function removeA(textarea) {
                  fetch('/remove-a', {
                    headers: {
                      'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
                    },
                    method: 'post',
                    body: 'text=' + encodeURIComponent(textarea.value)
                  }).then(
                    response =&gt; response.text()
                  ).then(result =&gt; {
                    document.getElementById('output').children[0].innerText = result
                  });
                }
            &lt;/script&gt;
        '''

    @app.route('/remove-a', methods=['POST'])
    def search():
        return request.form['text'].replace('a', '')

    app.run(debug=True)

You define a javascript function to be called for `onsubmit`.

The function uses ""AJAX"" (i.e. `fetch()`) to *""dynamically""* post the textarea's content to `/remove-a` in your flask app.

It then inserts the result into the `&lt;pre&gt;` tag contained in `&lt;div id=""output""&gt;`"

This could be anything, so long as it interest you. Say you want a simple app that checks the current temperature. Nothing too fancy. It's a very steep learning curve, but if you do it, you'll have learned a lot, and you can certainly put python down as a skill on your resume.

Other will disagree, recognizing that the simple app is a very big task. Maybe that's true, and you want to start with smaller things. For me personally I don't find much satisfaction in doing things I'm not interested in, so for me this approach doesn't work. Which is why I spend lots and lots of time with useless code with no apparent progress, but the progress is in the learning.

2020-06-23 19:10:27,Prexadym,"That's a design decision that needs to be made by the programmer (or the end-user.) For a single operation like this it doesn't make that much of a difference, 181ms is very little time. However, 60x speedup becomes very significant when you have tons of operations like this. If you have a lot of computations to do, this would be the difference between waiting 1 month for results versus running overnight and getting results the next morning. The big example right now is machine learning/deep learning /gpu accelerated computing, where efficient implementations can speed up training times from weeks to days.

On the other hand, sometimes it is worth writing simple, less efficient code that is faster to develop or easier to maintain. My example is too simple to illustrate this point, but when you start working on bigger projects it will become apparent that it's not always worth introducing tons of extra complexity (and therefore potential for bugs/errors) to save a couple seconds of computing time. In my example above, if you wanted to distribute this code to a co-worker, and they don't have admin permission on their computer, they might not be able to install numpy. In this case, the slower implementation may be worth using as it will run in pure python without any external dependencies. It's kind of a stretch for such a simple piece of code like this, but it quickly becomes an issue for bigger projects, especially with things like gpu computing. I pretty much had to re-write an entire project because we changed our computing resources and the new one did not support the version of CUDA I needed with my old code."

Computers are really good at some things, 3 - 1 = 2 a computer can chew through. If I ask ""John and his daughters Mary, Sue and Gromulax are walking through the woods and Sue is trampled to death by a freak stampede of 243 giraffes; How many daughters does John have left?"" your human brain can quickly work out the answer is 2. A computer has no context for that, if it was very advanced it might have a go at counting the daughter names, it might trip up on ""Gromulax"" as it doesn't match  a list of names it knows, it has to connect the two sentences with cause and effect etc."

`progress_filename` is not the filename of the uploaded file. I'll explain the situation. FFmpeg can write the encoding progress in realtime to a text file. I read this file in realtime using JavaScript Fetch ([app.js](https://github.com/BassThatHertz/AudioAndVideoConverter/blob/master/static/js/app.js), line 183), to display the encoding progress on the webpage for the user. `progress_filename` is the name of the file that FFmpeg will write to, and it's used in line 24 in [converter.py](https://github.com/BassThatHertz/AudioAndVideoConverter/blob/master/converter.py)

**Why am I setting the name of the file to the time since the epoch?**

Initially, I simply chose a name for this progress file, and the same text file kept being appended to by FFmpeg. But I realised that if two people were to convert a file at the same time, when the file is being read using Fetch, it would be reading the progress for both conversions since the progress for both conversions is being written to the same file, and this would confuse the user as the progress for the other user's file would also be shown.

So I decided that I will make a different progress file for each conversion and read the appropriate file, and I needed a way to make the filenames different (obviously). I could also generate a random string and make that equal to the filename, but I chose to use the time since the epoch as the filename.

I don’t see a reason to use a session for keeping track of a file name. Upload the file and return the name of the file to the client. Then the client can pass the name of the file as a parameter to the convert function. If the file doesn’t exist, throw an error. Otherwise, process it. Why is a session involved?

A better solution is to upload and convert the file in one operation if the processing time isn’t extremely long. You could also use a background task to process uploaded files automatically. I would keep track of the files in a database depending on the other details of the application.

I use python now for work a lot, (systems engineer), prior to this I was just using bash/powershell.

1) Repetition; if you use it a lot, even for small tasks, you will get a lot more comfortable with it without having to search up small syntactical thing.

2) Increase scope; try to work on a full project, for example I built a web scraper that scrapes a popular (the only?) lottery site in my country and gets all of the winning numbers and even goes back as far as they have archived, and stores those winning numbers in a database that grows as new draws (winning numbers) are released.

It then attempts to find some data in these numbers, ie. which numbers come up the most, find patterns etc. 

It's interfaced using a slackbot that's written in python as well. 

It was my first large project, and had many instances of revisions and even complete refactoring of certain parts as I found better ways of doing things.

I find you will learn a lot in this way.

3) read books, watch videos, follow random tutorials.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think there is an easy way to improve logic, if you mean you are not a logical thinker, maybe there are books to help with that, also you can make up for it by having understandings of if I want X I need to do Y. That would come from experience."

Let's take the AND operator as an example. This particular operator will only be true if both of its inputs are true. The truth table looks as follows:

| A | B | A &amp; B
---|---|----
0 | 0 | 0
0 | 1 | 0
1 | 0 | 0
1 | 1 | 1

Now notice that if A is 0, then A &amp; B is also going to be 0 regardless of what B is.

This is not the case if A is 1, in which case the value of B does matter.

As such, if A is 0, we don't need to check B, and we can simply evaluate the expression to 0."

2020-06-23 15:17:29,SirElixy,I don't think any podcast will help with that too much due to it being like radio. You'll want to look for more visual stuff like books/videos for that.  What's nice about podcasts though is you get to hear other developers in the community talk about everything else. Unless you have someone like that you can reach out too anytime.  Podcasts are the next best thing. Every episode is a potential mentor.

When you append to `repl_dict`, you're mutating a value. When you assign to `repl_count`, you're assigning to a name. Those are two very different acts; scope only applies to the second one."

\`0x3F\` is an integer, try writing it like \`b'\\x3F'\` which will make it a \`bytes\` object, if that doesn't work we can try adding that byte to a \`bytearray\` and passing that (though I think the BME modules already does this)"

Since you're splitting the line into words, the newline is discarded.

In general, `readlines` is better because it doesn't read the entire file into memory in one gigantic chunk, then split it. That requires memory twice the size of the file.

It reads it in pieces and splits the pieces as they come, so is far more efficient. (Even better would be not to create a list in the first place, but to process the lines one at a time. But as a compromise, readlines is the right way to do it.)"

2020-06-23 09:59:39,dadiaar,"The reason you are not getting replies is the rule about class homework. You are right when you feel you can improve your code because you are not using Python, that could be any language actually.

For example, nobody would write  `for i in range(len(lst)):`  when using Python, maybe something like  `for i, element in enumerate(lst):` , and even that `i` would be avoided in most cases. I understand you want the index to get the previous element so it's  not bad bad,.

Another one,  `if i==0:`  is equivalent to `if not i:` , and looks better.

More hints, keep in mind `for` loops are expensive (actually any loop). Here a [link](https://thenewstack.io/4-reasons-not-to-use-programming-loops-and-a-few-ways-to-avoid-them/) you can check about it. You have 2 nested loops, so if `lst` is 10 elements, you do that `10*10=100`, but if `lst` has 1.000.000 elements... well, no bueno.

`else: continue` , well, that is irrelevant.

`elif (lst[i]&gt;x) and (lst[i-1]&gt;x): continue` the same, irrelevant.

`if ans&gt;ans1: ans1 = ans` is equivalent to `ans1 = max(ans1, ans)`

`if (lst[i]&gt;x) and (lst[i-1]&lt;x): ans += 1` is equivalent to `ans += lst[i-1] &lt; x &lt; lst[i]`

You update `ans1` every single loop, and that's not necessary. Do it only at the end of the first loop.

`for o in lst: x = o` is equivalent to `for x in lst:`

Because `i=0` is special, you could just initialize `ans` with that in mind instead of `ans=0`,  avoid that conditional in every step and loop with previous and current elements:

I wrote the next code following the hints I gave you (you should do it yourself). Keep in mind that

* I still don't know what your code is supossed to do so no structural changes
* I didn't run it, so it may contain bugs

You may want to see if you can think another way instead of using 2 nested loops.

    def find_max_islands(lst):
        ans1 = 0
        for x in lst:
            ans = 0 + lst[0] &gt; x
            for prev, curr in zip(lst[:-1], lst[1:]):
                ans += prev &lt; x &lt; curr
            ans1 = max(ans1, ans)

2020-06-23 09:26:30,Diapolo10,"It's not really ""formatting"" as much as it is `print` just concatenating all arguments together after stringifying them. It's also exclusive to `print` as Python on its own would just treat it as a tuple outside of a function call.

I'd argue that it's okay for beginners and quick debugging, but it's not very flexible or pretty. F-strings are currently the best formatting option in most situations with `str.format` being a close second; the old C-style formatting shouldn't be used outside of `logging`.

This is basically how `print` works:

    import sys

    def my_print(*args, file=sys.stdout, sep=' ', end='\n'):
        file.write(
            sep.join(map(str, args)) + end
        )

As you can see, it just takes each argument, calls `str` on them to make strings and then joins them by the `sep`-parameter's value, which defaults to a space. If all you need is spaces, that's fine, but if you need flexibility this really isn't the way to go."

2020-06-23 09:25:28,crabbone,"&gt; each process spun off from the main program will get assigned to a different core, as you stated

Not quite. Usually, when people say ""assigned to core"" they mean ""locked to core"", that is also a possibility, but you need to request that specifically. This is desirable in real-time systems, where you want a core to be dedicated to running your program and not slack away by handling interrupts or other stuff that's not relevant to your code. Normally, what will happen is that the system will start executing your process on *some* core, and if it finds that it needs to execute something with higher priority (eg. processing user input, typically, takes priority over other stuff), then it might suspend the process (i.e. save its state in memory and create / restore another process to run on the core previously running the process). But, it doesn't have to be user input. Physically, there are only so many cores, but the system runs much more processes. So, it needs to eventually kick one process and replace it with another process to create an appearance of simultaneous execution.

&gt; f so, does this mean that each process spun off from the main process can also use something like ThreadPoolExecutor

Yes. Threads created in one process aren't shared when the process is forked (this is, I believe how Python creates sub-processes on UNIX-like systems which provide this syscall).

&gt; This all assumes every process spun off from the main process meets the 3 criteria (Independent, Asynchronous, No returns)?

No, these are just nice to have, but not necessary.

Your case would have worked... in principle. The problem with it is that modern infrastructure is highly counter-intuitive and suffers from a lot of ""improvements"" that were introduced in a form of small patches rather than complete system overhauls. So, today, using threads for I/O is considered... not great. I/O is relatively fast, especially network, while there's a noticeable overhead for context switching necessary to do regular blocking I/O in threads. There are two basic concerns wrt I/O:

1. How many context switches are necessary to perform some operation.
2. How many times the information needs to be copied.

Because of how traditional blocking I/O was implemented, the information had to be copied between user-space memory and kernel-space memory, before it would be sent to the device handling it. This also implied a lot of context switches to deal with the transfer.

This led to invention of asynchronous I/O. There are many different forms of it, but the idea here is that you don't need to create threads to perform multiple I/O operations simultaneously. Instead of data, the system call simply returns with some kind of ""promise"", and then either your code polls for I/O results using that promise, or the system code will ""wake up"" your code to handle the incoming I/O.

The above proved to be difficult to implement, and the current implementations are still kinda' broken. This is what's known as `epoll` or `select` etc.

I won't go into details of copying during I/O, but it's a similar story.

The newest kid on the block here is something called ""uring"" that's coming in the latest version of Linux kernel. I've not looked for it, but I'm pretty sure there has to be some Python binding for using it. Today, it's almost a must. ""Uring"" addresses both the blocking and the copying issues, and should be the fastest way around to do I/O on Linux. It, just as asynchronous I/O before it, doesn't rely on threads..."

2020-06-23 09:09:34,ninety_hex,"&gt; What does the tk.Frame argument mean while defining the class?

That means that the `ScrollFrame` class (and the `Example` class) ""inherits"" from,  is ""derived from"" or is ""subclassing"" the `tk.Frame` class.  Basically that means that the `ScrollFrame` class is going to be the same as the `tk.Frame` class except for the additions and changes made in thc`ScrollFrame` class code.

&gt; What is the super() function and why it is used with another __init__ function?

This is the way that the `ScrollFrame.__init__()` method executes the `__init__()` method of the parent `tk.Frame` class.  Since the methods in the `ScrollFrame` class replace any methods of the same name in the parent class, there needs to be some method of executing the `__init__()` method in the parent class to do the parent initialization before adding the initialization code specific to the child class.  The [`super()` function](super\(\)) returns an object that allows you to call methods of the parent class.  Your `Example` class uses an older method of calling the parent functions:  `tk.Frame.__init__(...)`.  `super()` is preferred because if you ever change the parent class name you don't have to change anything in the child class code.

&gt; What it is meant by placing the canvas on self? Isn't that canvas supposed to be placed on the frame? Or is self the frame itself?

Yes, the `self` in the class methods is a reference to the `ScrollFrame` widget.  So the `canvas` is placed on the parent `ScrollFrame`.  Note that the following line places the viewport on the canvas, ie, the viewport has the canvas as a parent."

2020-06-23 07:58:15,IDontLikeBeingRight,"So explaining trains of thought is awkward, and this might not even be the best approach, so just as hints:

1/ First write out a table of like the first 30 rows with columns of a/ input value, b/ binary value of that number, c/ change from previous binary, and d/ desired output.

2/ Next see that the desired output of any power of two N is 2N - 1. Eg, 16 -&gt; 2 \* 16 -1 = 31

3/ Then, thinking about holding the most significant digits fixed and only changing the least significant digits, increasing the input from 8 to 13 increases the output exactly as much as it does between 0 and 5. Because it's the same set of changes in least significant figures. So you can calculate the output for 13 by adding the output for 5 to the output for 8.

4/ The same trick means you could get the output for 5 by adding the output of 1 to the output of 4. And we know 4 -&gt; 4 \* 2 - 1 = 7. So you can get f(13) by doing f(8) + f(4) + f(1) and we can do those powers of two really easily.

5/ The remaining trick is to try to figure out what powers of two you'd need to consider for a given input, and for that the binary for of the input number might be insightful.

So if you kick those observations around, you might get so something that eventually simplifies to the ""2 \* n - cnt\_1"".

(Some of those ""observations"" you can prove, probably by induction, if that's you jam.)"

```
import numpy as np

def function(x,A,b,phi,c)
    y = A*np.sin(b*x+phi)+c
    return y
```

Defining the initial guesses is optional, but it might not work if you don't. Just make a plot of the raw data and have a look visually to make a rough estimate of what you think the amplitude etc are and then do:

`initial = (amplitude, angular frequency, phase, shift)`

Plugging in the appropriate values. Then simply call the function and plug in the appropriate stuff:

```
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit

popt, pcov = curve_fit(function, xdata, ydata, initial)

popt will then be an array of the best fit values for A, b, phi and c."

I wrote a little script that gives a nice list with one directory per line, plus some info such as if the directory did not exist or was already in the path. This is great for removing directories left over from uninstalled apps.

I was concerned that some of the path directories contained executables that shadowed others, i.e., they had the same name but were earlier in the path list. I wrote a script which uses the `where *` command to get the list of all executables. This works in combination with the `PATHEXT` variable. I found a critical suite of programs where the old install from chocolaty shadowed a much newer version. Shadowing can also occur very easily if you have some apps installed for all users and some just for you.

I enhanced both of these scripts to also work in the mingw64 and cygwin systems, and they will probably work, with minor tuning, on any \*nix with python3 installed."

    x = i * i
    
    print(""the square of your number is "" + x )

On the left side of the assignment operator should be the name of the variable that you want to store some value in. On the right side, should be the value to be stored in the variable.

Also, as an aside, python has a built in `**` operator, which lets you find the square of a number very easily, like so:

    i = int(input(""tell me an integer""))
    
    x = i ** 2

Here's the call to `check_events()` in alien_invasion.py:

    gf.check_events(ai_settings, screen, ship, bullets)

The arguments don't match up. The `screen` object in alien_invasion.py is being matched up with the `ship` parameter in the function. This is one of the shortcomings of the function-based approach in this project; you really need to pay attention to the arguments and parameters, and make sure they match up consistently.

In the second edition, the function-based approach has been replaced with a class-based approach. The initial setup is slightly more complex, but since the overall game is a class almost everything is accessible through `self`, instead of having to be passed between functions. Here's [the code](https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc_2e/blob/master/chapter_12/shooting_bullets/alien_invasion.py) for the class-based approach at the point in the project where the ship can fire bullets."

These are very important issues to consider, probably even before you start thinking about the UI. If it’s a lot of rows, then you need to consider your indexing very carefully (perhaps even consider full text search). If the database is massive, it’s not practical to preload all possible results into the application; you’ll need to do the search as each character is typed.

Also, just a suggestion, consider not starting the search until the user has entered at least 2 characters; searching for results with 1 matching character s likely a waste of resources, unless you have a small list.

2020-06-23 05:15:38,ninety_hex,"That code is working perfectly.  You tried to write the function **reference** `crack` to the file and you got exactly what you asked for.

If you want to write the data **returned** by a function you need to do:

    f = open('test.txt','a')
    f.write(crack())         # write data returned by the function, note ""()""
    f.close()

Unfortunately, your `crack()` function doesn't return anything, because `generate()` prints all its results.  There are two ways to solve that.

You could rewrite your crack/generate code to return all the generated ""crack"" strings and you then save those to a file.  That would require a lot of changes.

Or you could change crack/generate to accept a further parameter which is an open file handle.  Then when `generate()` has found a string of interest you could write that string to the file instead of printing.  So that part of `generate()` would change from:

        # print it out
        print(s)
        return

to

        # save the string
        f.write(s +'\n')
        return

You would need to open the file before calling `crack()` and close it afterwards.  A better way to do that is to use the `with` contect manager which will automatically close the file for you:

    with open('test.txt','w') as f:
        crack(arr, len, f)

2020-06-23 05:14:59,monster2018,"This is my simple way of doing it, I'm sure someone else might come along with a more sophisticated method.  But basically, think about how the  program works.  The way it displays all of the passwords is in the line `print(s)`.  What you want is to write s to a file each time, instead of just printing it.

So what I would do is open a file outside of any functions, like this `file = open(""outputfile.txt"", ""a"")`.  Then replace the `print(s)`with `file.write(f""{s}\n"")`.  That will write the string s followed by a newline character to the file ""outputfile.txt"", without the newline they would all be on the same line.  Then call `file.close()` after you call generate (or crack, since it calls generate).

In most, or at least many, situations, you want to use context handlers with files, which looks like this

    with open('output.txt', 'a') as f:
        #do file operations
but in this case, the way your function works would require opening and closing the file each function call to do it this way.  You could also have appended s to a list each time you print it, and then iterate through the list and write everything to the file then, but that would more or less double the number of operations, so yea.  The method I gave is the best I can think of.


Edit: Also I guess I'm not 100% what you're asking for.  The answer I gave is assuming that what you want is to save the output of generate to a file, instead of printing it."
2020-06-23 05:13:47,gurashish1singh,You're defining that variable as global in an elif block. Maybe try that outside your function.
2020-06-23 05:12:52,IvoryJam,"`enumerate` is your friend! It let's you go over an list with  the index and value at the same time, I plunked out a solution to yours also using f-strings, it let's you put a variable in a string in a prettier way. I also found that it would make a newline while printing so I used  `.strip()` to get rid of any trailing new lines or spaces.

If you have any questions let me know!

Basically that just has code that runs every time you enter a character into the Entry widget, and displays the list of ""matching"" entries in a ListBox.  You have to change the code in the `on_keyrelease()` function to create that list of ""matching"" entries.  To match leading characters the function would be:

    def on_keyrelease(event):
        # get text from entry
        value = event.widget.get()

&gt; Remove the item at the given position in the list, and return it. If no index is specified, a.pop() removes and returns the last item in the list. (The square brackets around the i in the method signature denote that the parameter is optional, not that you should type square brackets at that position. You will see this notation frequently in the Python Library Reference.)

My second idea is to do `list.insert()` the word `'and'` to the second-to-last position of the list.

So if this is your list:

`['red','blue','green']`

With `list.insert()` adding the word `and` into the second-to-last index place of that list, it would look like:

You say you want to minimise the number of employees: that solution would be employee 5. You also say you want to minimise the the wasted hours. In that case, the solution would be employees 1 and 3.

If it were just one of these constraints, it would be a linear programming problem (or possibly integer programming, which is more complicated). You can solve linear programs using scipy."

2020-06-23 03:13:35,Zunyr,"&gt;There's no guarantee that they will, actually, run in parallel (eg. the system has only one core, and so they won't), but, typically, you will be able to achieve some degree of parallelism.

So, each process spun off from the main program will get assigned to a different core, as you stated.   Does that mean we can we treat each one as an independent black box containing everything an individual copy of python needs to run?  If so, does this mean that each process spun off from the main process can also use something like ThreadPoolExecutor to speed up both CPU and IO bound tasks in one fell swoop? This all assumes every process spun off from the main process meets the 3 criteria (Independent, Asynchronous, No returns)?  The first use case I'm coming up with off the top of my head is high resolution image retrieval (IO bound) with image processing (CPU bound) after the download.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, can something like ThreadPoolExecutor be started up in the main function, and the executor object get passed around to receive executions in other functions without actually shutting it down until just before the main function completes?"

2020-06-23 03:10:20,deja_entenduu,"Usually when you get an ""undefined"" error it's because python doesn't recognize the variable. So in this case, you must not have instantiated the SFTPConnect class correctly and passed it to the variable ""ssh"". The function that I had at the end that was not part of the class should have worked as a template.  


If that still doesn't answer your problem can you paste it into a new codeshare? or as a comment? (taking out your user details of course). Then I can take a look and see what is wrong."

Derek, Kevin, and Sean sum to 12 hours? Don't you need 16 hours?

I think this would be a straightforward linear programming problem, but that seems like too much work for something this size.

If you just want the fewest workers to fill 16 hours, you can just sort by hours and take the bottom x until you get at least 16 (with the understanding some workers may not use up their entire time budget, e.g, 5 + 5 + 4 +4 = 18, which is more than the 16 required)."

If you are just curious, you can quickly google how to define classes and get a million good answers.

The important point though, is that a lot of the time, classes are not necessary, and functions work just fine. E.g. in this game, there is only one hangman happening. In maybe a role playing game, where you are creating lots of orcs to fight, you might want a class for Orcs, and every time you put an orc into the game, you create an instance of the Orc class.

But in a simple game like hangman or tic tac toe, there is no need for classes."

If you're trying to make the following matrix:

`array([[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5],`

`[ 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],`

`[ 1, 2, 4, 5, 6],`

`[11, 12, 13, 14, 15]])`

Then the correct argument for np.array() is

`arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8,9,10], [1, 2, 4, 5, 6], [11, 12, 13, 14 ,15]])`

When starting with the matrix, start with 2 square brackets \[ \]

then inside these square brackets you can add a row as \[`row data`\]

So,

`[ [row1], [row2], ..... [rowN] ]`

\^  will make the array/matrix:

`[[row1],`

`[row2],`

1. Travel
1. Photography
1. Music

Okay. So, maybe Abe can start writing an application which assembles playlists based off keywords from his and others' photos.

1. Use photo taken in 2009, of the Khafre Pyramid, in Cairo, Egypt.
1. Link into Instagram or Flickr for one hundred photos taken from the same location.
1. Assemble the set of tags used.
1. Use that tag set to compile a playlist of ten songs.

Presuming the sample size of photos produces a healthy tags list, you mind end up a song like ""Walk Like an Egyptian"", matching tags ""Egypt"" and ""Egyptian"". Maybe you later expand the program as a web site for others to share in your experience and to produce their own playlists.

2020-06-22 22:35:07,SoNotRedditingAtWork,"From a UX perspective, displaying ""Error"" and then terminating the program is not the best user experience. Letting the program fail with the original traceback error would be better in my opinion.  If you are going to catch an error and replace the error message with something else then the error should be more descriptive than the actual raised error message, not less.

Next it seems kinda unnecessary to do one loop that adds keys and a second loop that adds values. This could all be done with a single loop:

    dictmain = {}
    a = int(input(""How many names would you like to add?""))
    while len(dictmain) &lt; a:
        name = input(""Enter a name:"")
        phone = input(f""Enter the phone number for {name}:"")
        dictmain[name] = phone

Finally you use a comment  `#Instead of * enter your path` to tell the user they need to update the path to file they want to save the output to.  I would say that is a good opportunity to practice using function parameters.  You could have the function take a filename argument that way users don't need to change the function itself inorder to use it. 

    def dictionary(filename):
        dictmain = {}
        a = int(input(""How many names would you like to add?""))
        while len(dictmain) &lt; a:
            name = input(""Enter a name:"")
            phone = input(f""Enter the phone number for {name}:"")
            dictmain[name] = phone
        print(dictmain)
        with open(filename, 'w') as d:
            d.write(str(dictmain))

two final notes, I don't think you need `d.close()` since you are using `with open`. That should ensure the file is closed when the with `open block` is exited. Also  `if a == 0:` will fail as a safety check if the user enters a negative number to be assigned to `a`. Might consider using if `a &lt;= 0:` instead."
2020-06-22 22:34:36,vectorpropio,"Let's analyze the code at bird sight.

You define a function to roll an x faced dice y times (maybe I change meaning of x and you, but fir this analysis is not relevant).

You ask user if he want to roll (i feel this first question unnecessary, why i would run the script if i don't want to roll? ) and start a while loop.



You ask faces and number of time to roll, with some exception control. Call the function with the input data and ask if user want to roll again. 


Let's go back to the clause of the while

&gt;while Do_roll == ""y"":

But once you start the loop never assign nothing to Do_roll. The input at the end, when you ask user of he  want to roll again should change Do_roll instead of creating a new variable called Roll_again.

You created an infinite loop, and the only way to get out of it is with break. 

Let's see that if. There is an error i see a couple of times posted here, and it's ebanistería to write a full if, else when only an if es enough. 

    if Roll_again == ""y"": 
    #don't remove the line immediately below. It must be called Roller, the code breaks without it. No idea why. 
          Roller(Num_Dice, Size_Dice)
     else:
          print('Okay, bye!') break else: print('Okay, bye!') 

You can't make 

     if condition: 
     else:
          break

The **if** part have to have something to execute. Instead of that you can negate the condition and that's all. 

       if Roll_again != 'y':
            print('bye')
            break

But let's go back a little, this isn't needed, you should do

      Do_roll = input('Roll again? y/n\n')

That's all. The will will take carew of the condition and stop looping when user input anything different than y. 

I'm not sure about the exception handling, for something like this it seem like an overkill."

**Solution:**

Use `X.min()` and `X.max()` instead of `min(X)` and `max(X)`

**Explanation:**

The problem is that python min() and max() functions expect an iterable. Numpy arrays are iterables, but since your array is 2-dimensional, it is iterating over the rows of X. Thus, the min and max function is comparing vectors, thus it gives a boolean vector as a comparison and python cannot decide which goes first.

The numpy min and max function will handle that. You can specify the axis along you want to compute the minimums also."

Well, then don't work somewhere where you think they'll do that. If you feel like close mentoring is going to be the secret to your early success, ask potential employers about how mentoring in the workplace works and if they don't have an answer, tell them they're not a cultural fit when you decline the offer.

You're not entirely wrong to be worried about this but the answer is to exercise discernment in your job search and ask employers questions when they say ""do you have any questions for us?""

Generally what'll happen your first day is ""ok, here's your desk; here's your boss; here's where we host the codebase. Start reading through it and we'll see about having you work on some tickets in about three months from now.""

* When you resize your images make sure you are not also keeping the original in memory (loading all the originals into an array and then making a new array with the np.array version). Use generators to load each file from disk, convert and then close the file)
* Generators again, if you dont need to have all your images in a list then consider opening and processing em one by one with a generator (rather than keeping an array of the np arrays)
* If you really can't optimise enough for your memory capacity then you have to go to disk, You can use hdf5 if you like but honestly disk space is cheap so don't worry about getting too fancy if disk space is not an issue (JSON, CSV etc are just fine unless you have a constraint there)
* If you optimise the processing stage per above and still end up with a data-set too large for your RAM then you can dig a bit further with clever storage and retrieval tech, batch processing, reduce etc. Loads of options."

2020-06-22 21:22:08,crashfrog,"It's important to recognize the distinction I'm drawing, here, between variables and values. A variable is just a named reference to a value, and variables don't have types. `foo` is just a name and it can hold any kind of value.

Values, on the other hand, have types. Integers are different than strings, etc. Functions are a special type of value that is *callable*; when you use the calling operator `()` on one, the function's predefined behavior happens. Other values, like `10`, are *not* callable, and if you try to call something that isn't callable Python will tell you that it's not and crash your program with an exception.

Both

    foo = # something

and

    def foo():
        # something

define a variable `foo`; there's just a special syntax for defining variables with values of type `__function__` since they contain code blocks. In a conversational shorthand, we often call that ""defining a function"" but what we really mean is ""creating a callable function and then assigning it to a variable."""

Sure. The value the variable `foo` holds is a callable function, so we can call it using the `()` operator.

Indeed, you cannot - because the value `10` is an integer, not a callable value. If you actually run that code, Python will tell you what's wrong:

    TypeError: 'int' object is not callable

And indeed, integers aren't callable.

&gt; similarly even thou the variable is referenced to a function does that change the variable foo to a function.

It doesn't ""change"" `foo` into a function, `foo` was always a function. It's never not been a function."

2020-06-22 20:57:44,Atlantis_One,"I actually just learned this today while working on a project myself. I am working on a password manager and I wanted to make a button for every stored password, no matter how many I had, and show the username and password for that website when pressed.

I did that like this:

    self.btn_list = []
    for i in range(len(self.password_list)):
        self.btn_list.append(
            tk.Button(
                self.passwords.frame,
                text=self.password_list[i]['Name'],
                width = 25,
                command=lambda i=i: self.show_info(i))
        )
        self.btn_list[i].pack(side = tk.TOP, padx = self.PAD, pady = self.PAD)

So I create a list where I store all the password buttons.

For your particular problem, I would suggest storing them in an array instead of a list, since that makes it easier to remember which button is for what place. (For me it does not matter, since I don't really have to change it down the line.)

Hope you can use this as an example for your problem!"

List comprehensions  operate on a single element at a time. Accessing a single element in a list is 5x faster than accessing a single element in a numpy array, 22.1 ns rather than 123 ns on my pc. Lists are better for single-element operations.

A one-million-element multiplication operation on a numpy array is 50x faster than the similar list-comprehension operation, 1.28 ms rather than 64.2 ms. Numpy arrays are better for array operations.

So if you *have* to access single-elements because you can't find a suitable array-operation to do what you want, then maybe use a list. Speed is not everything though, and sometimes Numpy operations just look better because they are more elegant.

I meant that using multiprocessing instead of multithreading will cause bigger memory usage.

Let's take your picture and step through my pseudocode.

At the beginning, every line is in LinesLeft.

We step into the first `while`. Pick any line to start. In your picture, let's say we pick the bottom line of the backward-C to the left.

CurrentGroup = set(that line) \[in my pseudocode, I should have removed the line from LinesLeft here\].

We're now in the `where True`. We look for any lines in LinesLeft that are adjacent to anything in CurrentGroup. You can do this by checking the endpoints of LinesLeft against the endpoints of CurrentGroup. In this case, the only thing we can add is the right line of the backward-C. We add it to CurrentGroup and remove it from LinesLeft.

CurrentGroup is now set(bottom of backwards-C and right of backward-C). We are still in the `where True`. We look for lines adjacent to anything in CurrentGroup; there's only the top of the backward-C. Add it to CurrentGroup and remove it from LinesLeft.

We can't add anything further to CurrentGroup. We save CurrentGroup to the master Groupings set to be returned later.

Since C is compiled, it \*can\* run faster than Python, which is interpreted. Typically you will see significant speed-ups if you can vectorize your code, which involves using array operations without the use of loops (loop implementation in python is slow)

    %timeit test = [x**2 for x in range(int(1e6))]

    %timeit np.power([x for x in range(int(1e6))], 2)

    %timeit np.power(np.arange(int(1e6)), 2)

The first one is slow because all operations are done in python in the loop (list comprehension.)

The second one speeds up because squaring is done in numpy, but is still relatively slow because creating the list is in python.

The last one is fast because everything is done in C.

per the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.argv):

&gt;`sys.argv`  
&gt;  
&gt;The list of command line arguments passed to a Python script. `argv[0]` is the script name (it is operating system dependent whether this is a full pathname or not). If the command was executed using the `-c` command line option to the interpreter, `argv[0]` is set to the string `'-c'`. If no script name was passed to the Python interpreter, `argv[0]` is the empty string.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;if len(sys.argv) &lt; 2: What does the len(sys.argv) do?

Because this `sys.argv` list will always have the name of the script, other arguments provided will populate indexes 1 and on. If one wanted to check if no arguments were provided then they need to make sure the list was less than 2 items in length. Thus you have `if len(sys.argv) &lt; 2:`.

    print(winner())
    print(winner)

You will see that the first print line will be the result of the function, the value that it returns.  The printout will be `Computer wins`

The second printout will be a little bit more confusing, something like `&lt;function winner at 0x000001F2347C8288&gt;`

This is because the key word `winner` is already assigned, and it is defined as the function at some memory address (that's the 0x000001F2347C8288)

I know it can be a little confusing at first why `winner` and `winner()` are related and why overwriting `winner` wipes out `winner()`.  I hope that helped clarify a little!"

Tks a lot!"
2020-06-22 19:02:49,xelf,"Your question has already been answered, so let's tackle something else, rewriting your winner function.

First off, kudos to you for abstracting it out to it's own function. This lets you keep the rest of your coed much cleaner!

You have a lot of repeated code though, so we can probably clean some of that up.

For example, a draw is a draw no matter what both of them picked, as long as they picked the same thing.

    if player == cpu:
        return 'Draw'

Next up, combine all the ways a player can win and check them first.

    if cpu == 'rock' and player == 'paper':
        return 'Player wins'
 
    if cpu == 'paper' and player == 'scissors':
        return 'Player wins'
 
    if player == 'rock' and cpu == 'scissors':
        return 'Player wins'

Now you've taken care of all the draws and player victories. all you have left is teh computer winning:

    return 'Computer wins'

But we can also clear up the repeated code for the player by using an OR.

    def show_winner(player, cpu):
        if player == cpu:
            return 'Draw'
        if ( player == 'paper' and cpu == 'rock' ) or
           ( player == 'scissors' and cpu == 'paper'  ) or
           ( player == 'rock' and cpu == 'scissors' ):
            return 'Player wins'
        return 'Computer wins'

One last note, you'll notice I didn't use else or elif.  It's not needed if you're returning in the true conditions. The next lines can *only* be reached if the if was false."

2020-06-22 18:51:23,Zixarr,"ok so on line 4 you defined the winner function:

    def winner(player, cpu):
        if player == 'rock' and cpu == 'paper':
    ...

This makes `winner` into a sort of keyword that points to a location in memory.  That location in memory holds your function.  Later, when you call this function:

    winner = winner(playerChoice, computerChoice)

Python looks first at the right side of the = sign.  It sees `winner(playerChoice, computerChoice)` and knows you are trying to call a function because you have a word followed by ().  The key word used is `winner`, so python checks the place in memory that `winner` points to, confirms that it's a function, then runs it.

The function returns a string, something like 'Computer wins'.  Because you named the variable `winner` on the left side of the = sign, Python basically deletes your `winner()` function and overwrites the key word `winner` to now point to a string of 'Computer Wins' (or whatever the result of the function was the first time through the loop).

The second time through the loop, Python again encounters this line:

    winner = winner(playerChoice, computerChoice)

But by now, the `winner` keyword is just a string and no longer points to a function.  Again, ignore the left side for a second and what you are telling Python is:

    'Computer wins'(playerChoice, computerChoice)

Which does not make sense to the interpreter because 'Computer wins' is a string and by tacking on (playerChoice, computerChoice) to the end of it you are telling Python to execute that string as if it were a function."

If you have a singly linked list, nodes that get deleted should be deallocated, but whether the language does this for you or its performed manually in the code doesn't change the specification of the algorithm.

If you have an algorithm that runs in O(n) and another than runs in O(logn), for sufficiently large values of n, the O(logn) algorithm will run faster in Python than the O(n) algorithm would run in C, purely because of the efficiency of the algorithm itself."

If you haven't already I would suggest looking into Django Rest Framework to build APIs. The concepts that you will learn around Rest APIs and designing Databases will surely help you transition into other backend frameworks if needed.

And I can't say this about other jobs but from the little experience that I have had while hiring people, I have learned that knowing the exact stack is not necessary. I have hired people who worked in Flask and with a little training, they could easily transition into Django. Heck, I had a co-worker that came from a Java background, but his basics in Backend were quite good and he was able to pick up Django as well.

I am a self-taught programmer, never had an official class. So, I can relate with your anxiety about learning some of these things and getting worried if whatever you are learning would even be of any use or not. But please stick to it, It will surely pay-off. 

For a whole year back in college, I only did Android App development, I didn't even start with python. Yet now I don't do android app dev at all. While that 1 year might seem like a waste of time, it wasn't. As it helped me get a freelance gig in a startup through which later I got to work on my first Django app. And even today that basic Android knowledge comes in handy in meetings with the Android developers for whom I write APIs.

And after about 5 years of backend development with Django, I decided to pick up ReactJS this year and I absolutely love it. Maybe I'll get into React development full-time next year, who knows.

So don't get disheartened, just stick to whatever it is that you find interesting. All the best!"

So first thing I would do is get familiar a bit familiar with conda and jupyter. Conda is a Python distribution that is tailored towards data people. Many libraries will be far easier to install and harder to break when you install other stuff. You also want to learn about pandas. pandas is pretty much the equivalent to a dataframe in R. I'm working as a data scientist and I have to tell you that selecting, inspecting and cleaning data is a very big part of my work. Also if you are doing exploratory analysis and you constantly have to look up things you will probably end up not checking things or just checking them superficially. Then there is statsmodels and sklearn. Statsmodels gives you well statistical models and a lot of usefull tools for inference and so on. It's inspired by R, you can even use R's formula syntax to specify your model. SKlearn on the other hand is the machine learning library, you'll find a lot of classification models and very, very helpful utilities to work with your data, but no inference. So unless you want to calculate all your standard errors yourself, you probably don't want to use this in a scientific context. This is also an important question, do you want to learn Python to be a better economist, or do you want to learn skills for the job market. Because in the latter case don't bother to much with these two modules. Honestly people get scared if you use OLS. For a buisiess context I'd recommend to acquire the skills that allow you to gather data. Web scraping would be one thing, interacting with some API another one.

Generally I'd advice you to take one project, which includes creating your own data, preprocessing it and analyze some data. You said you like Micro, there are a lot of Multiplayer games for which a lot of data is available. These game usually include markets or force people to make economic decisions, I think that's a great source. When I studied burgeois economy I though about analizing POE.

If you are a beginner in Python, and programming in general, this is probably the best course that I've seen. Not only are you going to learn the tool (python) but you will be taught the fundamentals of the craft (programming).  Understanding the craft is very important in properly using the tool, especially when solving complicated or time-sensitive problems. A large part of the problems clients ask me to help fix usually stems from an implementation of a tool by persons that did not have a clear understanding of the craft.

Even if you are an experienced programmer in other languages this class with teach you python better than most other classes I've seen on other learning platforms.  I learned python piecemeal like others and even though a lot of the programming concepts I remember from my schooling in Uni, I did find some gems that had been pushed into the back of my head.  Regarding python, Eric Grimson, the instructor in the videos does a great job explaining both the syntax and the semantics of what is going on with python.

**for i in range(start, end, step):**

Now, instead of one number we have three. **Start** represents the number where you want the loop to start. In this example the start is **1**, because you don't want to start from 0, right?

Next one is **end**. This parameter is the exact same parameter that you use if you write **for i in range(36)**, which means that if you put 36, the loop will end in 35. This is the reason why the second parameter has the **+1** in there.

The third parameter is **step** and what it does is basically move in the number of steps you write. To understand it better, write this code and you will understand it better:

2020-06-22 14:54:06,Atlantis_One,"As Wikipedia says it:

&gt; **Recursion** (adjective: *recursive*) occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type. 

I find it hard to give a simple example, but the idea is that within a function, you can call that same function.

So for this partical example, as I said in my first comment:

&gt; What you would want to achieve, is to add up all the digits together, then check if that sum is higher is than 9, if so, run the whole thing again but with the new number. 

The recursive part is the part where you run the whole thing again.

So an example I saw somewhere would be calculating the factorial of an integer (n!).

    def factorial(n):
        if n &gt; 1:
            return n * factorial(n-1)
        else:
            return 1

What I want this program to do, for n = 3, is to run 3! = 3 \* 2 \* 1. But I also want it to work for n = 10, or n = 100. (I think there is a limit for recursion but I am not entirely sure how that works.)

So what is special about this problem, is that there are subproblems of a similar kind in it. So let's say n = 4, so I want to do 4 \* 3 \* 2 \* 1. But hey, that looks similar to 3! = 3 \* 2 \* 1. So I can describe this as 4! = 4 \* 3!, while 3! can again be described as 3! = 3 \* 2! all the way until 1! = 1.

So I can use of this property by doing exactly that:

    factorial(4) = 4 * factorial(3)
        factorial(3) = 3 * factorial(2)
            factorial(2) = 2 * factorial(1)
                factorial(1) = 1 # if it's 1, I don't want to continue

So filling it in from the bottom, we get the result we want: factorial(4) = 4 \* 3 \* 2 \*1 = 24.  But the key thing is that is does not matter whether it is 4 or 400, since it will just continue calling itself until it gets to 1.

This is how recursion can be very helpful. Granted, you probably won't use it a lot, but it is good to know how it works for uses where it makes sense.

A bit of a long answer and I am sure there are other resources out there to further learn about this, but hopefully this helps you in understanding how recursion works and how you might apply it to your particular problem."
2020-06-22 14:50:04,ninety_hex,"I got interested in tracking this down a bit more because I thought this behaviour should be documented.  Turns out it is, in [note 2  of the `list` doc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range).

People have been asking about this for a long time.  I found a mention in [issue 1408 of the python issue tracker](https://bugs.python.org/issue1408) where the final response was:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; map(int,['6', '8', '4', '0', '8', '0', '0', '3', '3', '8', '5', '4', '7', '2', '6', '4', '2', '4', '6'])
    &lt;map object at 0x7fa3f05e9760&gt;

map returns a generator, which is fine for further calls that expect an iterable, but to see the result, we turn it into a list again:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; list(map(int,['6', '8', '4', '0', '8', '0', '0', '3', '3', '8', '5', '4', '7', '2', '6', '4', '2', '4', '6']))
    [6, 8, 4, 0, 8, 0, 0, 3, 3, 8, 5, 4, 7, 2, 6, 4, 2, 4, 6]
    
Notice that the strings are not integers."

First of all, I want to remind you that the exercise is asking you to use recursion, which would work well in this case. The problem right now is that you reset whenever the sum goes higher than 9, not allowing it to finish adding up all the digits. What you would want to achieve, is to add up all the digits together, then check if that sum is higher is than 9, if so, run the whole thing again but with the new number. That is what recusion is. There is probably plenty of info online about how you can use that in detail, so see if that helps you figure it out.

Also, it is bad practice to name a variable 'sum' or something similar like 'max', 'min' etc, since that is also a function that you can call.

    x = sum([1, 2, 3]) # x is now the sum of the digits, so 6

This could lead to problems where it uses function instead of the variable and vice versa, but also makes it much harder to read your code and figure out what is going on.

Hope this helps you figuring it out. Let me know if you still get stuck on the recursive part."

2020-06-22 13:03:56,EphemeralNight,Thank you for the great read!
2020-06-22 13:02:59,JohnnyJordaan,"You have one bug too

    if (first_number == 0) or (second_number == 0):
        print(""Cannot divide by 0"")
    else:
        print(float(first_number / second_number))

first_number can be 0 just fine, you just need to check for second_number. `1/0` is not a problematic calculation.

&gt; Firstly, if someone was to enter a value not in the menu e.g. 6, the program makes them enter first_number and second_number before telling them the calculator is not that complex. I would like it to give the message straight away. 

So have an if-clause right there

    print(""My calculator"")
    menu_option = int(input(""1 - Addition 2 - Subtraction 3 - Multiplication 4 - Division 5 - Extras: ""))

    if not 1 &lt;= menu_option &lt;= 5:
        print(""this calculator is not that complex"")
    else:
        first_number = float(input(""first number: ""))
        second_number = float(input(""second number: ""))

        if (menu_option == 1):
            etc etc

But it may be a better idea to form a function around this

    from math import *

    def calc(menu_option):
        first_number = float(input(""first number: ""))
        second_number = float(input(""second number: ""))

        if (menu_option == 1):
            print(first_number + second_number)
        elif (menu_option == 2):
            print(first_number - second_number)
        elif (menu_option == 3):
            print(first_number * second_number)
        elif (menu_option == 4):
            if (first_number == 0) or (second_number == 0):
                print(""Cannot divide by 0"")
            else:
                print(float(first_number / second_number))
        elif (menu_option == 5):
            print(factorial(first_number))

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print(""My calculator"")
        menu_option = int(input(""1 - Addition 2 - Subtraction 3 - Multiplication 4 - Division 5 - Extras: ""))
        if 1 &lt;= menu_option &lt;= 5:
            calc(menu_option)
        else:
            print(""this calculator is not that complex"")

&gt; Also I tried to add something complex by incorporating factorials but it still asks for the second_number even though I only asked for first number. 

I don't follow? You literally have two succeeding statements asking for first_number and second_number. How is that only asking for first_number? But like with the incorrect menu option, you can also incorporate another `if` to handle the case where menu_option isn't 5."

No, by doing

you are deleting the key, that *also* deletes the value. It's in that order. A dict is a set of keys (look up ""Python sets"" to understand this concept), each with a value tied to it. What you can do is to set a 'blank' value to the key instead, which is what my 

    things[""thing1""] = None

does. Think of a dict a as a phone book, so by deleting the person (key) from the phone book, you also lose the number (value). What you are asking is to remove the phone number (value), but somehow keep the person (key). That can be done by using a blank value (which is where None is for in Python)."

&gt;errVal =userData.get(val)\[1\]+1 if line.find(""INFO""):  
&gt;  
&gt;infVal=userData.get(Val\[0\])+1

This is raising quality red flags for me and I'm not even looking at what the code does or what it should be doing.

* there are apparently two different variables called val and Val
* the infVal one is indexed before the userData.get while the errVal one is .get whole and then indexed afterwards
* there's no comment indicating why these two treatments are different or indicating what either should be doing

The other comment about correct formatting is the first step. For the second step I'd recommend something like [doctest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html) as a pretty low effort way of getting some automated testing around your functions. Consider putting everything in the ""for line in file.readlines():"" loop in it's own function, for which you can then build doctest cases to ensure each different type of line is getting processed as it should."

* So I was watching this anime- FMA Alchemist, 60 episodes so 60 subtitles and it was a pain to manually load subtitles in VLC player before watching each episode as the subs files did not have the same name as the episodes file.

So i wrote a small script to change the names of all the subs to match with the episode names, i worked like a charm. From next time onward, subs got automatically loaded when I played any episode.

I was fun, I got to learn about the OS module.

Later, I also wrote another script to sort the things- PDFs, .EXE files, etc- in the downloads folder in my PC. Again, a fun activity.

And a little bit later, I wrote another script to download YouTube videos using Selenium module. Loved doing it and thanks to StackOverflow in helping me out.

Again, a bit later- I learned to make GUI app in python using Tkinter. So I had an assignment to use an IBM Watson service like Image Recognition, Lang. translation, etc. So I made a GUI and with the help of some APIs, that bad boy worked and translated every single word thrown at it."

2020-06-22 10:32:07,MrJKeating,"# Setup

Imagine you’re playing with a friend and you’re glueing things together, but you only have one glue stick.

# Non async

You start by glueing the things together and then wait for them to dry, so you can glue another thing on top. After you’ve glued this as well and it also has dried you give the glue stick to your friend.

# Async

You start by glueing the things together and then wait for them to dry. Because you can’t use the glue stick right now you give him to your friend.
He now starts glueing and as soon as he needs to wait for the things to dry, he gives it back to you.
You now glue the second layer and once you’re done doing that you hand over the glue stick to your friend again while you wait for things to dry, he glues his second layer.

I don’t know how understandable that is to 5 year olds, but it was worth a try.

This is what’s called “cooperative multitasking”, which means your code signals when there’s a good time to be interrupted. Usually when it’s waiting on something (in this case the glue to dry)

Preemptive multitasking would be if instead of handing the glue stick over, every 10 seconds your mother comes and takes the glue stick away from one of you to hand it to the other."

2020-06-22 09:44:18,lonewolfwithclubsoda,"`async def` means the function is actually a coroutine. All this means essentially is that the function can be “paused” and resume the rest of its execution at a later time. You tell the coroutine where it can be paused by using the `await` keyword, where the await keyword is followed by an awaitable object. With await you’re essentially saying pause until the awaitable object is done. So it quite literally means await the completion of the object.

This “pausing” functionality is not actually useful unless you run your async code within the context of an event loop (one implementation of which is provided through the asyncio library). The event loop will say run this coroutine and when it hits the “pause” point the code execution bubbles back up to the event loop at which point the event loop will look for other coroutines that have satisfied their awaiting condition. When it finds a coroutine whose awaitable object has completed it will give control to that coroutine to execute the code that comes after its await statement.

This is an oversimplification and you can actually use yield to pause the execution too, and there are some nuances in terms of executing certain things to run at the same time, but this is just to get the basic idea across."

2020-06-22 07:39:17,thebigbeel," did you use pip or conda to install pyperclip? 

I use pip.

 does your python file have a ""shebang"" line? this can also affect the python executable that runs the file. 

What's a shebang line? Where can I see this?"
2020-06-22 07:38:59,notFatality,"First:

`import pandas as pd`

`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`

If i understand the question correctly you want a bar graph that shows number of movies on a given platform. OK step 1 what columns show us this? I believe its the names of the sites so 'Netflix','Hulu','Prime Video','Disney+'. Next what info is in those columns? 0,1. I'm going to assume 1 means that platform has the movie 0 means they dont. Since it only contains 1 and 0 i can just add up the entire column to know how many movies there are in a a given column. Lucky for us there is a pandas method `.sum()` . To use .sum() you must preceed it with the info you wanna add, what i mean is

`df[column].sum()`

obviously you need to store this somewhere so id consider a list. if we say

`num_movies = [df['Netflix].sum(),df['Hulu'].sum()...]#note ... i mean you put the rest of relevant columns there`

Now we have all the movies a given platform hosts. Now we have to plot this. I use the `fig, ax` syntax.

`fig, ax = plt.subplots()`

What this does is it makes a figure object and an axes object. The axes is where we are plotting so use [`ax.bar`](https://ax.bar)`()` to make a bar chart.

[`ax.bar`](https://ax.bar)`(x=range(1,5),height=num_movies)`

So x is where on the x axis do you want to center each bar. Range(1,5) returns a list \[1,2,3,4\]. So i want a bar at 1,2,3,4 now height asks how tall does a given bar have to be. We passed in num\_movies wich is how many movies are on a platform. At this point is you said [`plt.show`](https://plt.show)`()` youd have your bar chart but it would be unlabeled and kinda ugly bc too many xticks. To only have a tick mark where we have a bar you do this:

`ax.setxticks(range(1,5))`

To label it do this:

`ax.set_xticklabels(['Netflix','Hulu'...])` \#again you put in all platforms there im too lazy

At this point your bar graph is good enough. So, your graoh code top down should look like this roughly:

`fig,ax`

[`ax.bar`](https://ax.bar)

`ax.set_xticks`

`ax.set_xticklabels`

[`plt.show`](https://plt.show)`()`

Obviously i omitted stuff \^ cause im lazy but i hope you get the picture"

2020-06-22 06:13:53,Fantastic_Horse1454,"It again depends on how you want to run the ""other stuff""

In the original example, the functions written in place of ""pass"" will be executed every time the loop runs.

for example

    while True:
        if keyboard.is_pressed(""e""):
            start_time = time.time()
            while keyboard.is_pressed(""e""):
                print(""E is being pressed"")
            print(time.time() - start_time)

""E is being pressed"" would be repeatedly printed as long as ""e"" is pressed. This, if not desired makes things really ugly.

On the other hand, if you want to perform some task only one the following way would be to do it

    while True:
        if keyboard.is_pressed(""e""):
                if key_pressed == False:
                        start_time = time.time()
                        key_pressed = True
                        print(""E is being pressed"")
        else:
                if key_pressed == True:
                        print(time.time() - start_time)
                        key_pressed = False
    

This would print ""E is being pressed"" only once while the key ""e"" is being pressed"

2020-06-22 05:14:45,JAnonW,"Made a self-post but figured maybe it could fit here too since it's not a crazy question about coding

Hi, I'm either going to try and learn how to or pay a developer on a freelancing site to create this for me, but before I do either of those I'd like to know if the app I have in mind is even possible or not. Tl;dr at the bottom.

I'd like to create a program that maps terrorist events around the world using crawlers and a database of sorts. There is an added part of the program at the bottom that isn't necessary but it would be nice to have.

I essentially see a window with a few buttons, one to go into the **crawler section** of the program, one to go into the **adding section** of the program, and one to export the database or edit existing data in the database.

The **crawler** window has a button to run crawlers to search a news website for new indexed articles on a certain day. After it finishes crawling, another button on the same screen will pull those articles up one by one and allow me to say ""yay"" or ""nay"" as to whether or not they are relevant to the events I want to map. The crawler will pull the title of the article, date it was published, body content, and assign it an ID in the database.

The **adding** section will display this information the crawler has pulled on the screen along with the ability to add new information such as a box to add a translation of the article, a location finder that works by typing in a string which is compared to a separate database filled with locations tied to coordinates and IDs. The location finder has the ability to manually input a country, a region, and finally a city or landmark. This helps narrow down the location easier if the country is known since now the program just has to scan the database for locations in that country or region. This location finder relies on an additional part of the program I will explain at the bottom. The Adding section also lets me specify through information in the article the type of terrorist event, wounded, and dead. There will also be a way to add what group was responsible and what the target was using a similar thing to the location finder. There will be a separate database that contains a list of targets and attackers. These will also be assigned IDs. After the article has been scanned and all information entered, it will be added to the database which is in an excel format unless there is some better way to store data like that.

The **final window** just lets me pull up existing IDs added to the database and edit them, delete them, etc. or export the database as an excel sheet. Although I don't know if I would need to do that since the data will all be contained in an excel sheet to being with, right? Or is there a better way to store data like the data I want to collect. I imagine there will be tens of thousands of IDs and each ID will have probably 10+ variables associated with it (Title, Date, Body, Translated Body, Attacker, Target, Location, Coordinates, Deaths, Wounded, etc.

The **location finder** is one thing that I know is probably possible with Python, but I don't know where I would find the information I need. I'm hoping someone here knows of an existing database that contains the coordinates, name, and other common spellings of every city and town in say Germany with the possibility of adding more locations to it that are missing. A paid or free database. Or maybe there is a way to pull all this information using Python or some other program? Just picking brains here.

I'm really just trying to flesh out my idea for this program and bounce ideas around. I am in no way looking for advice on how to code the whole thing I am mainly looking for a Y/N answer about whether or not it's possible in Python, how much such a program would bill, and a nudge in the right direction. I have dabbled in Python before and other languages, but have never made something from scratch like this. I know this is a tall order for a beginner, but I'd like to code it myself so that I understand how it works internally and can edit it to my liking down the line.

Tl;dr - Is it possible to create a program that crawls and pulls articles from websites based on keywords that are then manually entered into a database with other information such as coordinates, casualties, etc. that cannot be reliable pulled using code? Scale from 1-10 how hard to code from scratch for a beginner? How much would it be to bill for? (how many hours maybe? I know rates are different for different devs) Thanks!"

2020-06-22 05:00:18,Neighm,"Glad it works for you, to be honest I was pretty pleased it worked for me!

I'm sure you figured it out, but the idea is that the layers list will contain the 5 ""blocks""  of text you want to see in the output.

The first for loop distributes the board positions, in groups of 25, into the 5 blocks. For each block it breaks it down into strings of 5 positions, and puts that string into the block. If you take the first string in each block and concatenate them together you get the first line of output. The second strings, concatenated together give the second line, and so on.

I basically worked back from what you wanted in your output and figured out a data structure that would hold the text for each line in some sort of order to allow the line to be constructed."

So if the goal would be to run the code multiple times for different websites, it will only save the last one. This can be changed by choosing a different mode for opening the file, 'a' for appending. Then I would advise to add another newline to separate the different passwords. It would give something like:

    signup_website = input(""What are you signing up for? "")
    
    email = input(""Email: "")

It's the standard textbook for [intro crypto classes](http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~tal/4261/F19/index.htm) at my institution. It assumes a little bit of familiarity with mathematical proofs, number theory, and probability, but it also does refresher chapters for those.

[Dan Boneh](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/) from Stanford is a great crypto educator. He has a [free Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto) on introductory cryptography and [another free online course](https://toc.cryptobook.us/) on applied cryptography.

&gt; multivariable function generator where the number of independent is the password length and used that on the password a random number of times

Good point. I actually misspoke earlier (I will edit my original reply to clarify) but what you're describing is a [polyalphabetic cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyalphabetic_cipher) which is a more complex and slightly better way of doing it, but can still be cracked easily with a more sophisticated method of frequency analysis called [Kasiski Examination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasiski_examination). Katz and Lindell actually describe both of these ciphers and attacks in the first chapter, so I'd encourage you to check that out if you want a better explanation.

For this sort of cipher, the more you obfuscate, the better encryption it ends up being, but ultimately it is still susceptible to certain attacks which modern cryptography avoids entirely by focusing on a concept called ""provable security"" -- basically the notion that even a very simple-looking cipher can be perfectly secret as long as it meets a few conditions that have to do with probability and indistinguishability.

If you look at the design of AES, the most common encryption standard, it turns out that most of the steps are actually very simple operations, nothing so complex as multivariable functions. The reason for this is that analyzing the security of such a scheme is easier when the operations are simple, so it's less likely that an obscure kind of attack will slip by unnoticed, and also the actual encryption process is computationally faster. After all, if your cipher takes a long time to run, nobody will use it and all security is lost.

There's a common saying that ""all cryptographers know how to do is XOR,"" because many of the most successful encryption schemes, at their core, are just a series of XOR operations (one of the quickest and most basic things you can do with a bunch of binary data)."

The highlighting and scroll bars work but there are many tags such as &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; in there.  I may be bad with the SyntaxHighlighter Evolved plugin.  Does anyone else use SyntaxHighlighter (a Wordpress plugin) or Wordpress or have any recommendations on how to display code on websites for tutorials?   I wanted to start posting my work to keep myself going and hopefully help others."
2020-06-22 02:24:46,primitive_screwhead,"&gt;could you change how your data is stored instead?

Yes, this data should likely be either:

    [('bob', 4), ('bill', 9), ('john', 1)]

or

    [{'name': 'bob', 'value': 4}, {'name': 'bill', 'value': 9}, {'name': 'john', 'value': 1}]

which are both forms more typically seen in YAML or JSON data structures, or maybe Spark for the first one.  And it's for precisely the reason that the schema is independent of the key content."
2020-06-22 02:24:07,stebrepar,"SQLite can do an in-memory database. It's access to disk (or any I/O really) that's slow by comparison.

As for doing an operation every 30 minutes, assuming your code has some main loop already, it would be fine to do the deletion of old records on each iteration (like: delete from my_table where my_timestamp &lt; datetime('now', 'localtime', '-30 minutes') ). Or you could keep a local timestamp for the last time you did the deletion, and do the delete when the current time is 30+ minutes later than the last delete time, then update the last delete time to the current time."
2020-06-22 02:23:14,throwaway_the_fourth,"When you share a Python program with someone else, you are sharing its source code. This is because Python is an interpreted language, which means that the Python interpreter reads the Python source (your `.py` files) and executes it. The alternative to this would be a compiled language, where a compiler translates your source code into machine code, which runs natively on your computer.

This means that when you share your program with someone, you must share the script source. Another comment in this thread links you to a library that will help you obfuscate your scripts, which will make it harder for people to get readable source code of your program, but not impossible. Anything can be reverse-engineered with enough time and effort, even a compiled binary.

If you really need to keep your program source secret, then you can't share the program. You could consider adapting it into a web application and running it on a server, so that other people can make requests and get responses without having access to the source."

2020-06-22 02:21:08,cult_of_memes,"I'd add the recomendation to create a tool for automated file searching and processing.

Specifically, I'd suggest you start by creating a directory somewhere on your root directory (linux:`~/some_dir/...`,
; windows: `%HOME%/some_dir/...`) and fill it with images of variouse sizes and types (png, gif, tif, etc.). Then you can use different built-in python lib tools to perform customized search and filtering operations on those image files. 

###suggested libraries
(In no particular order)

* `import glob`
  * [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html)
  * `glob.glob(pathname=""~/**/some_dir/*.png"", recursive=True)`
    * searches full directory tree rooted at `~/` and returns a list of all path strings that contain the folder named 'some_dir` and ends in a file with the `.png` type extension (returning only after it has searched the full directory sub-tree rooted at `~/`.
  * `glob.iglob(pathname=""~/**/some_dir/*.png"", recursive=True)`
    * much like `glob.glob(...)`, `iglob` traverses the directory tree rooted at `~/` but will return a generator object that yields individual path strings as it finds them. 
  * You can use the `glob` lib to perform regex searches on directory path strings and specifically select files based on substring matches
* `import os`
  * [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)
  * to be continued... gotta hit the road bu I'll finish when i get home."

2020-06-22 02:12:54,mastershooter77,"Wow didn't even know that could you recommend a book for getting started with cryptography? Also sorry just 1 more question i find cryptography very interesting would it work if i used a random(as random as computers can get)multivariable function generator where the number of independent is the password length and used that on the password a random number of times like if the password is ""run""
Then the function could be f(x,y,z) = x^z + tanh(y) for the first word and then a different function for the next (the domain would be appropriate)


 then i would do the same thing a random number of times with random multivariable functions(they encryption key would be long for a long password) and then finally the list of numbers would be converted to numbers or symbols if they were integers then the resulting encrypted password would be a list of numbers and alphabets and special characters im thinking this might be insecure too."

    import sh

What is really great about the [projects in this guide](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/08/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners/) is that the author keeps a really good balance between feeding you code line by line and letting you bang your head against the wall trying to figure out how to even start the project.

It helps you break the project into smaller parts and gives you some hints along the way, IMHO this is a very important stage before throwing yourself at a project and end up frustrated.

One day you can ditch the crutches and start working on something on your own, but acquiring this mentality of breaking a project into smaller parts is a very important takeaway from this guide.

There are other articles in the same blog where the author is discussing a reader's approach to implementing the project and helping them improve it.

2020-06-22 01:06:21,onemywaybackhome,"Funny, I just solved this yesterday. Here is my solution. I sort both armies in descending order and see what my score would be if I played my biggest army against my opponent's, my second biggest against theirs, etc. This might not be optimal because if I am going to lose, I might as well pit my smallest army against their biggest. So check this, I rotate (roll) my list of armies by one, putting my smallest army first followed by the other armies in descending order. Then I pair up my armies with my opponent's and see what my score would be. I continue rotating and return the best score. BTW the (c - o)/abs(c - 0) returns -1 or 1 for loss/win.

These values are stored in something called an ""OFMD"".

The ""OFMD"" is structured like so.

    # 4F 46 4D 44  - ""OFMD"" identifier

    # 18           - The number of frames in this ""OFMD""
    # 80           - Number of PG sequences (Not important for me)
    # 00           - Number of IG sequences (Also not important)

Like, Java, python is completely cross platform, so long as the interpreter is installed. That said, the interpreter isn't installed by default on most Windows machines, so make sure it's on there before attempting to execute your script. Another constraint is to try to write backwards compatible code because not all *nix and Mac machines use the latest python interpreter. Code compatible with the Python 3.5 interpreter is usually a safe target to assume your code will be running on. That means you can't use the latest and greatest coding niceties, but that's okay because the `zipfile` API hasn't changed much other the years and I'm sure whatever parsing you're doing could be done even in python 2.

* Is the job to make pairs out of all values in two lists, so they are arranged as much as possible in your favour?
* How are wins draws and losses translated into overall score? Is each set of values its own world, where maximizing the number of wins is the only thing that counts, or could there be a point in having more draws, to avoid a loss?

If I understand the rules correctly, it seems to me that you should play your lowest values against the opponents highest values, until your highest value is larger than the opponent. The you keep playing high vs. high, until you stop winning and go back to play low vs. high."

2020-06-22 00:09:05,Criptid,"I can see at least 3 problems.

1. The method of randomly generating m and n. True random generation doesn't exist in computer science; the best we can do is pseudo-random generation. If you just do something like math.random(), that is not guaranteed to be a ""secure pseudo-random generator,"" which is a very particular specification that you have to be aware of.

2. I'm not sure how you would restrict the range of the quadratic to [0,26]. My inclination is that however you would do this, if it is possible, would either severely limit the number of possible values for m and n. This opens up your encryption for a very simple attack that totally destroys it: If the number of possible values for m and n is less than about 2^90 (a VERY big number), then your cipher is not secure. I'm assuming m and n are integers because they're stored in integer binary, so the number of possible values is probably WAY less than that, opening you up to a [brute force search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack). Also, even if the keyspace is quite large, it might still be insecure because of a property of pseudo-random generators called ""[indistinguishability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext_indistinguishability),"" which describes how much the distribution of values looks like that of a true random generator. Since your polynomial is heavily restricted, it likely has a very specific distribution that is in fact not as random as you hoped, and as such can be exploited to be solved much quicker than usual by attackers. Also, a more complicated attack is a [related-key attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Related-key_attack) which is possible due the restrictions you've placed on m and n, or alternatively (maybe overkill), [linear cryptanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_cryptanalysis) (at least partially, depending on how linear the polynomial ends up being).

3. What you've effectively done is design a very elaborately-generated [polyalphabetic cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyalphabetic_cipher), which is a historical cipher known to be insecure. The Enigma Machine cracked by Alan Turing (see *The Imitation Game*) during WWII was actually more difficult to crack than yours, and his computer did it in about a minute. The reason is a little complex, but basically the problem is that any cipher which simply rearranges letters of the alphabet is fundamentally susceptible to a number of very simple attacks, the most obvious being called a ""frequency analysis attack."" Since your one polynomial is used to encrypt the entire password, you can analyze the frequency with which certain letters appear in the encrypted password compared to how often they should appear in the English alphabet. Like e is the most common letter, etc. By doing this, you can make whatever e is mapped to by your polynomial, and get a very accurate sense of what the polynomial is. This might be harder with passwords than, say, the text of an email, because passwords might not follow these frequencies so well, but there are numerous other trivial attacks which could solve this. The reason is that the polynomial, no matter how it seems like it would be obfuscating and adding complexity, is marred by the weakest link, which is the fact that you're essentially doing a more flamboyant polyalphabetic cipher. And as I said before, I'm pretty sure your polynomial itself could be cracked without ever bothering with the methods I just described, because there is a broad rule of thumb that polynomials are a very bad thing to use in cryptography since they can be solved in, well, ""polynomial time,"" i.e. as a function of how big your inputs are.

So maybe this gives you an idea of some of the defense mindset you have to put on to write secure ciphers. It relies a lot on probability, number theory, and complexity theory. I encourage you to learn more about what makes a good encryption. I personally find it a very fascinating topic!

I will note that the most popular encryption scheme to date, AES, actually uses something sort of similar to your method in one of its steps, albeit over a large binary set rather than the small set of the alphabet. The reason is that random substitution is critical for cutting off any possible linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. Unfortunately it's not strong enough to do *just* that.

A fun thing to do would be to code the encryption you've described and then use one of the attacks I described to crack it with a [ciphertext-only attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext-only_attack)."
2020-06-22 00:06:10,usernamecreationhell,"What you are looking for is something I would call ""guided practice"". Unfortunately, there are very few resources that do it well in my opinion.

I strongly recommend you go through  [Test Driven Development with Python](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/pages/book.html#toc) as soon as reasonably possible. It will be far outside of your comfort zone but it's really good at the guided learning aspect. In test driven development (TDD)  you write tests first before you write the corresponding functionality. As a result, in the book, you will first write tests and then you can put the book aside and try to right code that will make the tests pass on your own. When you need help, you can always look things up online or look at the solution in the book. That makes it very scalable in terms of difficulty. As an added benefit, you also learn to solve problems yourself instead of copying code you see some course instructor write on the screen.

The whole book is very ""wholistic"" in the sense that you don't just learn Python, but also a lot of peripheral skills like version control, HTML, a tiny amount of JavaScript, some devops skills, etc. This makes it both challenging and extremely valuable for a beginner."

You don't need to do what you say you want to do, because it doesn't actually make sense. What you need to do is tell us what you are trying to *achieve* and not *how* you want to do it.

From your question, I gather you want to access some instance variables of an instance of another class, within another class, or you want to access class variables from another class; neither is a good idea. The problem you have is that within your instance of class B, an instance of class A is not in scope, so you can't ""see"" it. What you probably need to do is pass those variables into your instance of class B via code that *is* in the right scope, which will be the same scope where you instantiate both the classes. This would work, but is kind of shonky:

'''
class A:
  def __init__(self):
      self.X = ...
      self.Y = ...

class B:
  def __init__(self,x,y):
      self.X = x
      self.Y = y
      ...

a = A()
b = B(a.X,a.Y)

I looked a bit more closely, being able to run it and actually as far as I can see, the change you made in the original comment should work. I have it as:

    def word_builder():
        letter_set = input('What are the letters to play?   ')
        main_letter = input('What is the middle letter?   ')
        full_word = letter_set + main_letter

        playable_words = []
        with open(""words.txt"") as w:
            for word in w:
                list_of_words.append(word.rstrip('\n'))
    
        for word in list_of_words:
            if set(word).issubset(full_word) and len(word) &gt;= 4 and main_letter in word:
                playable_words.append(word)
            else:
                pass
        print(f'there are {len(playable_words)} playable words, the largest word is {max(playable_words, key=len)}')
        cheat = input('would you like to see the words? y/n... ')
        if cheat.lower() == 'y':
            print(playable_words)
        else:
            print(f'alright, better not to cheat')
    
    word_builder()

The problem was indeed that you did not consider the full 'word' and only looked at words with the letters around it, making it impossible to meet the `main_letter in word` criterium. Running this should work perfectly."

2020-06-21 23:13:50,LoopyChew,"My suggested approach is to ask yourself, “what problem am I trying to solve?”

Learn any language and work from there, but one that’s “closer” to what you want to do is better. You want to learn AI and ML, Python is apparently the place to be. 

From there, learn the fundamentals. ATBS is pretty good for this kind of thing but listen to the others in this post, they’re probably more experiences than I am (I’m more of a PowerShell guy but I’m learning Python for kicks).

Break down the problem you’re trying to solve into smaller bits with the fundamental knowledge you have. Think of it like Legos, where you build smaller bits and assemble things closer to the end. There may be several phases of “break it down into smaller bits,” so don’t worry if you break it down and it still seems too big. You can keep breaking it down.

One thing I like doing, personally, is making an outline of what I want to do, like a checklist, but commented out line by line. Then I fill in the code underneath each line. This means I’ve done at least the basic commenting so I know what I was trying to do because inevitably I’ll biff it somewhere.

Google is your friend! People learn from other people all the time. If you try to solve a problem and someone else has done the work, then look at what they’ve done. Remember to comment with a link so you remember where you picked it up from, and break it down so you understand what they’re doing. It’ll make your life easier in the long run.

Start small! Think of a simple problem you want to solve. Then graduate to bigger problems. To quote *What About Bob?,* it’s all about baby steps.

As time goes on programming languages have broken ""mallet"" programming features into multiple ""scalpel"" programming features.  A great example is turning goto into a function, while loop, and for loop.

More modern languages like Scala embrace this having tons of precise programming features.  The goal is to make code more readable when using precise programming features, as they express the intent of the author better.  The downside is now you have to learn a bazillion different programming concepts, instead of 5 concepts.  Picking up a programming language used to be a very quick and easy process."

In self-documenting code, if you have one complex line of code that could use a comment, you can break it into two or three lines where the variable names contain the same knowledge as the comment, making your code easier to read.  So, it's not just functions.  In real world use cases, you'll often find adding descriptive variables is better than creating functions, depending on the situation."

2020-06-21 22:50:42,TehNolz,"&gt; You end up with various versions installed because they are not backwards compatible and why is that?  
  
The only major compatibility problem is between Python 2 and 3. Code that runs on 3.8 will work on 3.1 just fine, provided it doesn't use any new features. You shouldn't be using Python 2 anymore, as its no longer supported.  
  
&gt; To learn python you first must forget everything you know about other languages: if else ? nop, if elif .  
  
This is just a minor syntax change. You certainly don't need to ""forget everything you know"", because `elif` still acts just the same as `else if` does in other languages. The underlying programming concepts are still the same, the syntax is just a bit different.  
  
This isn't just a Python-only thing; *every single language* uses a different syntax for certain things. Figuring out how a language's syntax works is part of the learning process.  
  
&gt; Why did the developers of python made it this way ?  
  
Because software developers all have different ideas on how a concept should be implemented or how a feature should work, and nobody can agree on which idea is the best. This is why we have multiple programming languages to begin with; people didn't like the available languages, so they decided to make their own ""better' language."

2020-06-21 22:35:58,Atlantis_One,"&gt; The += was used because I thought that it would mean the customer one total plus all the other variables. 

This is exactly what it does.  However, if you did not tell the program what the customer one total is, it cannot add anything to it. Just as in my previous example, if I tell you to take x and add 1 to it, can you tell me what the new value is? You can't unless I tell you what x was to begin with. So you have to tell it what it's starting value is by, well, assigning it a value before using it. 

So maybe there is some miscommunication, but assigning it a value is nothing more than this:

    customer_one_total = 0

You can of course assign it a different value, but for this case I suppose you want to start just with 0 and add the different values to it.

But as I mentioned before, in this case it does not make sense to use +=, since you just want to add a couple numbers. You can just add them together, without adding them to an already existing value.

    x = 0
    x += 1 + 2 + 3 # takes x, which is 0, and adds 1, 2 and 3, giving 6 and assigns that to x again

is the same as

    x = 1 + 2 + 3 # adds 1, 2 and 3, giving 6 and assigns that to x

However, this is only true when x is 0. So in that case, the second option makes more sense. If x is non-zero, the second option just gives 6 instead of adding it to the previous x-value.

So in a more general sense: if you want to use a variable and do something with it, you should make sure it has a starting value somewhere, otherwise you can't manipulate it."

I learned a lot about utilizing os.walk over os.listdir for nested folder structures. Also I used suborocess to execute the 7zip.exe and the importance of using stderr/stdout with subprocess.PIPE and the communicate() function. I'll never forget when I ran the script and saw it was running without error. Watching the files appear in the output folder made me feel as if I've just harness some kind of computer voodoo lol. That was 4 years ago. The excitement from the success that night set me on a path that has taken me from being a button pusher on second shift to a salaried data automation team lead position. Two of my scripts alone had saved the company an average of 55k a year for the last three years. And it all started with being annoyed that I would have to manually extract 50 files lol.

2020-06-21 21:51:54,primitive_screwhead,"&gt;I'd love to hear any suggestions on how to do this better/more efficiently.

The str.translate() method mentioned elsewhere will likely be fastest.

&amp;#x200B;

However, for your method, the repeated string concatenations are not too efficient; every string concatenation requires copying all the elements of both strings, and will thus get slower after each concatenation.  The more Pythonic idiom is to use a list that you join() once at the end:

    string = '101010011'
    lst = []
    
    for digit in string:
        if digit == '0':
            lst.append('1')
        else:
            lst.append('0')
    
    new_string = ''.join(lst) # Convert list of characters to string
    print(new_string)

and this can be done compactly w/ comprehensions and ternary:

    string = '101010011'
    new_string = ''.join('1' if x == '0' else '0' for x in string)

&amp;#x200B;

But str.translate() will also automatically leave alone the non '0' or '1' characters:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; s = '10101abc0011'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; new_s = s.translate(str.maketrans('01', '10'))
    &gt;&gt;&gt; new_s
    '01010abc1100'"

Edit: I thought git rebase is equivalent of git rebase origin master?"
2020-06-21 21:13:23,Atlantis_One,"I thought the same. However, as a beginner myself, maybe a more elaborate explanation could be helpful for OP.

So first of all, you should think of what `+=` does. It is simply a short way of adding something to an already existing variable. So the two line below are the same.

    x += i
    x = x + i

Maybe seeing the full version you can see where the problem lies. Let's try a little example with actual numbers.

    i = 3
    x = x + i

Think about what this should achieve before continuing reading. I think that will help you learn the most.

&gt;!The answer is that is depends on what x is. If x  is 0, the result is 0. If x is 2, the result is 5. So the problem is that it does not know what x is and can therefore not give you an answer. As mentioned above, in more technical terms: !&lt;

&gt;&gt;! The issue is you never initialized customer\_one\_total and customer\_one\_itemization variables prior to these 2 lines. !&lt;

&gt;!So you have to tell the program what those values are, before you can add anything to it.!&lt;

&gt;!So to solve the problem, you can assign a 0 or '' to those values, giving you something to add to. However, in this particular case, why do you need += anyway? Think about that and let me know if you still have problems.!&lt;

Also, the print statement in the last line does not do anything without parentheses and something to print, but I am assuming that is just not finished."

You code has apostrophs around every line, making it impossible to run without manually removing all of those. Also the different code blocks and inline code style make it harder to understand what goes together and what not. Secondly, what are you trying to accomplish? As far as I can figure out, the first input is all the characters allowed, while the middle letter input is just a random letter which the word has to have?

Why that is important is because the problem is clear: the argument in the max() function is empty, as the error message says. That means that none of the words in the text file meet the criteria below and therefore the playable\_words list stays empty.

 `if set(word).issubset(full_word) and len(word) &gt;= 4 and middle_letter in word:` 

So you should really think about what you are trying to accomplish with this if-statement and how that ties in into the inputs used for this statement.

If Python did parse things like you suggest, what should be the result of:

Should Python know that, in this circumstance, you mean for f() to be called three times, and not once (as is written)?  Or in this case, should it work differently than if it had been just literals being evaluated?

If Python special-cased the literal evaluation to work differently than normal multiplication, under what exact circumstances should it be special-cased?

How about:

    def f():
        return [[0]*3]

Means where you need to send the request, you got 3 options, we want the json one as it's the easiest to parse.

2020-06-21 20:16:11,Atlantis_One,"I am a beginner myself, but I'll try to see if I can help. I think it really depends on what exactly you are trying to achieve. You mention you want to append something to a list and give an example. However, that example is very specific: you have a list with a single input, which is a list as well, to which you want to add another list with the same amount of 0's as the first input. But what would you want the code to do if the original list has multiple lists in it, and what if they are different lengths: how many 0's would you want to add? Or would you like to add something else than just 0? 

As for your specific example, this code should work:

    t = [[1, 2, 3]]
    t = t + [[0 for _ in t[0]]]
    print(t)

This code uses list comprehension for put a 0 for every item in t\[0\]. The extra square brackets put that list in another list, to have the same 'level' as the original list. Then it adds those two lists together to give the output you want.

But as I said before, this code only works for this very specific problem, so I would try to look for something more general to fit your use case.

As for the second point not working, as far as I know that is due to something called aliasing. You can assign a different name to a variable, but they remain linked, so changing one, changes the other as well, resulting in them always being the same. If you want to create a new variable to compare to your t, my code example should be changed to t\_new or something.

    t = [[1, 2, 3]]
    t_new = t + [[0 for _ in t[0]]]
    print(t_new == t)

If you're willing to work with pandas, you can import that data into a dataframe with the   `pandas.readcsv()` function, where you give a path to your text file, and can specify one or more delimiters for how to split up the text. So if it's a .csv file, you can pass ',' for a comma, or you can separate by white space or tabs or whatever. 

You can also let pandas infer the names of columns as the first row in your file, you can give explicit column names, or tell it to ignore columns and many other options. Just check the documentation on pandas.readcsv for the options, or in general if you can find tutorials on pandas file I/O it will have tips. 

After successfully importing the data, it's now all in a dataframe. If you want it into a dictionary, you could use the dataframes .to_dict() built in method to convert it into a dictionary of series or list like data. So something like `example_dict=example_df.to_dict()`

I don't know exactly what format you want your final dictionary to look like, but there are a couple different options you can give to the .to_dict method for how the dictionaries are created.

Functions are designed to **ACT** on data provided directly to the function. That's the purpose of functions; to manipulate data, calculate things. They should be small, large functions are usually frowned upon. It doesn't matter if all the bloat comes from a huge switch/case, or a long ladder of if/else conditions. Those themselves are frowned upon.

If you need to provide data that has multiple fields, that have built in functions that act on said data without needing to pass them to the functions, make a class."

First of all, it doesn't matter.  You can write any program without any functions at all, ever, so if you don't feel you need to, don't.

Second, you can change your mind!  If you get three quarters of the way through writing your code and realise, oh, hell, I really, really should have made this a function...well, you can.  

At the end of the day, remember what a function is.  It takes some variables, and gives you back a variable.  If you're doing such a calculation and might want to do it more than once, it's definitely a candidate to be a function.  You might even write a function if you're doing it just once, to make the main flow of code easier to read.

A lot of coding is craftsmanship: should I cut this piece of wood with a saw, or an axe?  That depends on lots of things: are you burning the wood, or making a coffee table?  Do you have a saw and an axe?  What if you have an apprentice to do the hard work, does that change your mind?  Same with code - what you do depends a LOT on context, tools available, your time, and what the end result needs to be.  The right answer comes with time and experience - but also, notice these questions are a lot easier to answer with concrete examples than as abstract questions."

2020-06-21 17:58:46,Atlantis_One,"I am a beginner myself (finishing up my first course on Python), but I feel this can be done more efficiently. In the course I was warned about this type of loops, since the runtime increases quadratically with longer lists.

So this is what I came up with:

    A = [0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1]
    B = [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1]
    print(A)
    
    for i in range(len(A)):
        if B[i] == 0:
            A[i] = 0
        else:
            pass
    
    print(A)
    print(B)

The prints are of course for illustration purposes, just as you had. 

I decided to not make a new list, since OP did mention he wanted to change the values in the existing list, not make a new list. This also enabled me to make the code even shorter by allowing me to use the 'pass' statement instead of having to assign a value to the new list. Most importantly, this avoids the quadratic increase in computing for longer lists.

Downsides would be that this code assumes the lists are equal length, the code breaks if B is shorter than A. However, that is an assumption that was stated in the original question, so I don't think that is a problem. 

Also, I saw the solutions using the fact that it is basically an AND condition. That probably is even better, but I think it's good to come up with different ways to do this. This structure could be used for similar problems that aren't a strict AND condition.

2020-06-21 17:41:22,InvertedRainbow,"It's a part of a programming paradigm. There's functional programming, procedural and object oriented and some others. 

Class belongs to the object oriented paradigm. 

You could create a function in a game to render a ball for example. To change the color of the ball, you could create another function to change the color of the ball.
Now imagine you have many balls in the game and you want to give them each a different color and they each do something else when they hit something. 

You'd get code that's hardly maintainable and it becomes hard to see which function belongs to which ball. 

Object oriented programming deals with this problem by creating classes. For example:

    class DefaultBall:

All the balls are round and bump into stuff. The bumping function and the shape will be functions in the DefaultBall class. And therefore they're nicely packed together. Now if we want to create a red exploding ball, we can do this:

    class RedBall(DefaultBall)

Which is called inheritance. The redball can now do everything the default ball can do. But in the redball class we'll define two more things. The red color, which is a property of the ball, and the function explode and maybe something like cause damage to surrounding. 

This makes you're code more organized and less redundant. The other advantage of this is that you can create infinite red balls or default balls by creating a new instance of a ball. Like this:

    Redball1 = RedBall()
    Redball2 = RedBall()
    Defball1 = DefaultBall()

There are some more advantages, for example if you would like to change the color of Redball1 to blue, then you can. But in functional programming you'd have to write a function for each ball or pass in a bucket full of arguments to make it work correctly. With object oriented you simply do this:

    Redball1.color = ""blue"""

However you get the same effect if you want with virtual environments. And it’s left up to the user how they want to install your app. 

For example: They can install you package in the global, as you point out is adding clutter and is discouraged. 

But if they want they can add it to its own environment. Which would be just like what you described. Only the needed files would be pulled, but instead of you having to host them they would be pulled from the repositories. Same end result as you want. 

Or the user may want to save space and avoid installing QT multiple times by using one env for several similar programs.  The benefit here is if you need to deliver an suite of apps. You can make sure they all run on the same packages.  In other words you don’t have to have a one app to one env, you can have one to many. Depending on the user.

But, you want to use functions even when there isn't code reuse.  If you logically think about how to break down a problem into steps, each of those steps could be a function.  This makes your code more readable and more testable.

This is where test driven development comes in.  Think about the possible inputs into each step and the possible outputs.  Write about up some tests with those expectations.  Make sure to include tests for edge cases, null inputs, etc.  Then code the function and make sure it passes those tests."

2020-06-21 16:50:07,misho88,"That's mostly right, with the following exception:

&gt; you're creating a list of values that are put into a dictionary which becomes the columns?

It's a list of rows. `(df &gt; lim).mean()` creates a `pandas.Series`, which is more or less an vector or array of values that's somehow annotated in that the series can have a name and each value can have a custom index of some kind. Each series becomes a row of the dataframe, but you want it to be a column, thus the transposition. A dictionary is not involved in what I wrote above; however, relating to my comment on initializing with slightly-different arguments, you could do a dictionary comprehension instead of a list comprehension:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; pd.DataFrame({ lim: (df &gt; lim).mean() for lim in limits })
                   10000  1000   500

    Student Loans    0.0    0.5    1.0

&gt;Instance Attribute  
&gt;  
&gt;An  instance attribute is a Python variable belonging to only one object.  It is only accessible in the scope of the object and it is defined  inside the constructor function of a class. For example, *\_\_init\_\_(self,..).*  
&gt;  
&gt;Class Attribute  
&gt;  
&gt;A  class attribute is a Python Variable that belongs to a class rather  than a particular object. This is shared between all other objects of  the same class and is defined outside the constructor function  \_\_init\_\_(self,…), of the class.  
&gt;  
&gt;Differences Between Class and Instance Attributes

2020-06-21 16:18:09,POGtastic,"&gt; Why do you want to return false if a file exists? 

This function takes a filepath, and it's answering if it's a) a folder and b) contains no jpegs.

If it's a file (or doesn't exist at all), it fails Condition A.

&gt; You are just saying to go next if you can't use the os.walkfunction?

Nope. `os.walk` returns a **generator**, which is a fancy container that lazily evaluates its elements.

Calling `next` on a generator returns the next element in the generator. If there are no remaining elements, it raises a `StopIteration` runtime error. For example:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; g = (x for x in range(3))
    &gt;&gt;&gt; next(g)
    0
    &gt;&gt;&gt; next(g)
    1
    &gt;&gt;&gt; next(g)
    2
    &gt;&gt;&gt; next(g)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    StopIteration

In the case of `os.walk`, the first element to be generated is the tuple that represents the current directory.

---

Now that we have a list of dirs and files, we do the following:

* Check to see if all of the files do not end in "".jpeg"". If a jpeg is in the current folder, return False.
* Otherwise, there are no jpegs in the current folder, but there might be some in the subfolders. We are going to call `folder_contains_no_jpeg` on each of the subfolders and see if they don't contain a jpeg, either.

This logic is kinda weird. Why do we have a function that returns `True` if a folder does not contain something? The reason is that `shutil.copytree`'s ignore function takes a list of folders and files to **ignore**. So we need a function that will return `True` if the folder does not contain a jpeg."

For example, when you get to 12, you get 144/12 = 12, causing you to count 12 twice. This is why I add an if statement to check that the number is not a perfect square."

2020-06-21 16:12:52,dslfdslj,"Functions are a great way to structure your code. One strategy where they are really helpful is the top-down approach where you first write down the skeleton your code with invocations of functions which you have not defined yet. 


Example:

    # script which copies content from one file to another
    content_to_copy = read_content(""file1"")
    write_content_to_file(""file2"", content_to_copy)

The two functions above still have to be defined. But by putting them into context of your final script you have already fixed their behavior: ```read_content``` takes exactly one argument, the filename of the file from which you want to copy. Also, it returns one value, namely the content of the file.
```write_content_to_file``` takes two arguments, namely the filename of the file to which you want to write, and the content you want to write. Now that you have defined everything from the high level, you can start and implement the functionality easily."

2020-06-21 16:07:17,dupelize,"By ""In general"" do you mean is it better to add a flag to a function or make a new function?

I'd say the answer is yes.

If the function is small add a flag. A function with two args and three lines turning into one with three args and six lines is probably better than a new function which will just complicate the section of code where it is called.

If you have a function with ten flags that 40 lines, maybe adding more isn't great. However, if it's part of a public API in a package, maybe it is okay. For example, pandas `read_csv()` has a ton of args and kwargs, but it's easier to remember than having a `read_csv_no_header()`, `read_csv_header()`, `read_csv_usecols()`...

I think the ""general"" rule should be small functions with few flags, but that rule is more like drive under the speed limit than don't kill people."

2020-06-21 15:25:54,aTairyHesticle,"Thank you, that's interesting. I see now that it makes much more sense for python to do this by default, while deep copying should be done explicitly. I still find it confusing, since there's no reason why in the case of

    table = [[0]*3 for _ in range(3)]

\[0\]\*3 doesn't initially evaluate to \[0,0,0\] then get copied just as before. If I do 

    [myobj for _ in range(3)]

I expect to have three of the same myobj, so why does it suddenly behave differently in

    table = [[0]*3]*3
    vs
    table = [[0]*3 for _ in range(3)]

I didn't have any extra budget or internal development resource and the product we were using was new and not a focus for the company that released it. They hadn't spent any time on reporting, in fact to view a report with the 4 million+ customers we have in the system takes over 30 minutes to generate and can't be exported on our end.

Luckily, I'd built a good relationship with one of the support people and he was able to send a CSV with the basic events and timestamps I needed to build my own reporting. Using python I was able to pull the data I needed from the CSV, write it to our internal database and join it with the customer transaction data to determine the financial benefits. I also had it auto update an excel dashboard so I could copy and paste the output each month to share with key stakeholders.

The manual version of this took me hours, with the python script it was less than 10 minutes from receiving the data to sending the email.

I only had a GUI access to the database which meant that I was instructed to manually type each of the 100 000 suppliers' IDs to the GUI and fetch a couple of information from each and then find out if there was a duplicate for this supplier. In addition, the logic for supplier duplicate was not straight forward: some duplicates could not be deleted due to open payment stuff or something and not all of the relevant data was found from this GUI. If I had done what I was instructed, I would have been brain dead after the summer and done like 1% of the task.

Instead, I decided to find out how I could install Python and Pandas and then asked around if I could get the data somewhere else. It turned out our DBA could pull the data which was like several millions of rows. Then I built the logic with Pandas and managed to accomplish the task in like 2 weeks while I was expected to do this the whole summer (with a likelihood of not finishing with it).

2020-06-21 13:58:00,gordiank,"Yes I only activate the conda environment when needed. By default upon installation, conda auto-activates the `base` environment when you open a shell. I deactivate this behavior by running conda `config --set auto_activate_base false`.

Do **not** install any packages (including python) in the `base` environment, always create a specific environment for your needs.

Good to know: the Python binary will be located in `[conda_folder_usually_~/anaconda]/envs/[your_env_name]/bin/python`. This can be useful if you want your favorite editor (Visual Studio Code, Pycharm...), to use your conda env installation (you can easily find tips on how to configure this).

Another use case is running shell scripts, when you want your script to use your conda environment. You can check [this answer](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/577347/383339) (or others you may find). The trick is to copy the conda snippet inserted at the end of the `~/.bashrc` (this snippet is usually applied upon anaconda installation) into a separate file such as `~/.bashrc_conda` and source it. This allows you to use the `conda` command within your shell script, so you can do something like this:

`source ~/.bashrc_conda &amp;&amp; conda activate [your_env_name &amp;&amp; [python` `script.py` `or whatever command]`

Alternatively you may run the Python binary by pointing to its path in the environment (shown above), but when possible it's preferable to activate `conda activate` the env.

Maintenance tips - how I do updates:

1. Update conda itself

Make sure to deactivate your conda environment and run:

`[conda deactivate]`

`conda update conda`

`conda update --all`

2. Update packages in your conda env

`[conda activate your_env_name]`

`conda update --all`"

2020-06-21 13:06:33,stevenjd,"&gt; I know WHY it does that

You really don't, because you are talking about ""copied by reference"" and ""copied by value"" when [Python uses neither](https://effbot.org/zone/call-by-object.html). So you're operating under a misapprehension about [how Python works](https://import-that.dreamwidth.org/1130.html).

Copy by value is not a serious option, because:

1. That would require the interpreter to single out a single operation and change the parameter passing mechanism for that one operation. That in turn would require a huge change to the way the interpreter internals operates, to build in support for copy-by-value.

2. It would also be pointless for the vast majority of use-cases, where the objects in the list are immutable, so copying them is a waste of time.

3. It would also be exceedingly expensive to copy arbitrary objects, which could be arbitrarily big.

4. For other objects it wouldn't be sufficient to do a shallow copy, you would need to do a deep copy, which is even more expensive, requiring arbitrary amounts of memory and time. Doing this every time somebody does sequence repetition would be horribly expensive.

5. And if you think you can have a rule like ""only copy mutable objects"", how do you propose the interpreter tells which objects are mutable?

There's also the design principles:

* Python (almost?) never copies objects unless you specifically tell it to. Copying is costly, so if you want a copy, you have to do so explicitly.

* Sequence repetition is explicitly documented as being equivalent to repeated sequence concatenation: `[obj]*3` is equivalent to `[x] + [x] + [x]`. This matches integer multiplication, and makes it easy to understand the behaviour compared to some more complicated process.

* See also the Zen of Python: `import this`.

And last but not least, there are some nice tricks we can do with sequence repetition. You want to iterate over a list in triplets? Easy:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; L = range(24)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for t in zip(*([iter(L)]*3)):
    ...     print(t)
    ... 
    (0, 1, 2)
    (3, 4, 5)
    (6, 7, 8)
    (9, 10, 11)
    (12, 13, 14)
    (15, 16, 17)
    (18, 19, 20)
    (21, 22, 23)


That wouldn't work if list repetition created independent copies."

2020-06-21 12:26:54,ninety_hex,"Well, after some more thought, the `*` operator on anything vaguely numeric does exactly what is expected.  It's overloaded for other things, like strings, tuples, lists, etc.

A string multiplied by N results in a new string with N repetitions of the original.

A list or tuple of simple objects like integers multiplied by N results in a new list or tuple with N repetitions of the original values in the list or tuple.  For tuples (or any immutable object) it makes sense to just duplicate the reference in the original list or tuple.  For mutable objects the code just does the same thing, probably because it's easier at the expense of running into the problems you saw.  Modifying the behaviour for mutable objects in the list so that each original element is **copied** would add overhead and make the behaviour slightly different when using tuples/lists.  Or the copy could be done for *both* lists and tuples at the expense of possibly quite a bit of overhead.

I think all that went through the BDFL's mind before he decided on the simple approach - no copying, just reuse references of the original objects."

2020-06-21 11:39:11,OnlySeesLastSentence,"Don't worry about it.  I spent about 20 minutes yesterday wondering if for some reason my function wasn't saving values because it was treating them as local variables for some reason.  I reworked my code to return a value and still it seemed my variable wasn't saving, so I did research about scope, and it suggested that no, the variables shouldn't be acting like they're local. 


Turns out after about 20 minutes I realized my error was in copy pasting  my if statements and not changing the comparisons. 

That is, I had like a bunch of code saying something like

If myArray [r][c]==1

(Stuff)

Elif myArray [r-1][c] ==1

(Stuff)

Elif myArray[r][c+1]==1

(Stuff)

Basically ""stuff"" was supposed to be replaced by code that has me change the corresponding value to, say, 2. 

There was like 16 cases that I had to deal with, so to save time, I copied the line on each elif and pasted it below, and changed the 1 to a 2. 


Only problem?  I was burnt out from all the coding that I didn't realize the booboo when I had 


If myArray [r][c]==1:

myArray [r][c]==2

2020-06-21 11:27:23,OdysseusXD,"In my experience, sometimes initially you don't know if using a function can be better, so you write some lines thinking it's being used only once. Then you might find yourself in a situation which you realise you have to use the codes again. So now you can think of going back and making those multiple lines of code into a function and use it again.

What I' saying is, sometimes you write the normal code first, without a function, but then you find out it can be turned into a function and used again. So the code came without a function first, but then turned into a function.

Also, another usage of functions is giving flexiblity to your code. Meaning that when you define a function instead of multiple lines of code, they exist independent of where they are used. They can be used any time. They can also be moved around and still have the same function. But some lines can't be moved around easily. I don't mean because they are multiple lines and it would be harder to do it because of that. I mean they are not easy to move around because they have dependencies and their order of usage matters. Either they(e.g. group A) are dependant on other things(e.g. group B) which have to come first, and so group A can't be used sooner; or other things(e.g. group C of lines) is dependant upon group A, and moving group A around carelessly can cause problems, like some variable not being defined or some event that was meant to happen does not happen anymore. If you identify something is not dependant on other things, it's good to wrap them in a function before going further into the script. Because later, identifying them is harder because there's more code and you have to check more things to see if they are dependant or not. When the code is longer, it's harder to find what things are related to each other directly and depend on one another. Basically, being more organized gives you more flexiblity. ●● so in short, I've learnt that if somethings can work independant of other things and can be devided, separate them from others and define a function for them once, then use the function instead of the actual lines of code, even if I'm using it only once. So the only usage of functions is not repeatability, but also flexiblity.

P.S. : If anyone can explain what I'm trying to say in easier to understand text, please do so for the benefit of others. I tried to put it as simple as I could in the amount of time I have."

This image should be a 1500 by 1500 png, provided by myself. Perhaps it could be a picture of California, proportioned so that it is at the center of the image and that it takes up the majority of the image without exceeding the borders.

Suppose I now feed the program a city within the state. Perhaps it is Los Angeles. I want the program to be place a pin at location of LA, like how google maps does it, along with a text box which includes the name of the city. I want to be able to manipulate where the text box is placed next to the pin based on some rules.

A the higher level you read to do X perform the following three steps, each one a function call. Then you're either satisfied or you read the details of the steps you're interested in.

In the same way you can write code top-down, that is, write down the abstract steps as calls to functions you haven't written yet, then define those functions afterwards.

For example something like this  (replace all names with names that make sense):

&amp;#x200B;

    def foo():
        x = collect_input()
        x2 = preprocess(x)

You could make the program repeat itself by making a loop (for instance a for loop). However, if what is inside the for loop becomes complicated, it's better to put the content of the for loop in a function and call the function multiple times. Example: calculating scores for multiple players is a game. 

Other times it's not something you repeat in a loop, but a task you have to do often. Like checking which player of two players is ahead in game. You could use the same function for calculating score and compare the results."

Functions can make your code more readable as well as more reuseable.

At the end of the day, there is no time when a function _should_ be used. It is always up to the developer (or the company you work for, if they have a style guide). You should do what _feels right_. This only comes with experience.

In this case you might be tempted to put a comment above the code block to explain its purpose, but if you like to make your code ""sell-documenting"", you can achieve that by encapsulating the block into a function whose name serves the purpose of explaining what it does.

To be clear though, that's really a stylistic choice. A block of code which would otherwise be repeated should *definitely* be made a function, but making a once-used function whose sole purpose is to avoid a comment is up to your (or your group's, employer's etc) personal preference."

2020-06-21 07:17:00,Eitan1112,"I think it's a valid way. But there are maybe 2 other options I think about (not directly python-related)
1) If the data from the prpgram is fetched through an external API, you can query it directly.

2) You can you ""procmon.exe"", a program that shows you what a process do - specifically relevant what files or registry keys it touches. If you see that the program has a local sqlite DB, you might query it directly. If it saves it to a registry key, you can lookup that key.

For each letter of srring.ascii_lowercase you are testing if it's in the string. If it's, you are putting a one in the list, if not you are putting a zero. Then you are joining those elements. So let's think the string is

The reason is that the conditions for an encryption to be ""secure"" are very specific and difficult to implement, not to mention you also have to be vigilant for innumerable possible alternative attacks on your scheme. It takes years of training and multiple certifications before people are allowed to write encryptions for actual use.

            return all(folder_contains_no_jpeg(os.path.join(root, dir)) for dir in dirs)
        return False

We can now update our ignore function.

    def should_be_ignored(filepath):
        if os.path.isdir(filepath):
            return folder_contains_no_jpeg(filepath)
        return get_ext(filepath) != "".jpeg""

    def new_ignore(current_dir, files):
        return [f for f in files if should_be_ignored(os.path.join(current_dir, f))]

So our function call is now

    def copy_jpeg_folders(source, target):
        shutil.copytree(source, target, ignore=new_ignore)

Performing the function on our `test` directory:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; copy_jpeg_folders(""test"", ""test2"")
    &gt;&gt;&gt; exit()
    [pog@pogbox ~]$ tree test2
    test2

    └── foo
        └── quux
            ├── eggs.jpeg
            └── spam.jpeg

Feel free to ask about how any of this works. It took some fiddling to get right because of how all of the various `shutil` and `os.path` functions work with relative paths vs absolute paths."

2020-06-21 04:53:33,anecdotal_yokel,"While the other replies may help you somewhere down the line, I’ll try to give you a real answer. 

If you do the exact same thing more than one time; use a function. 

A function is just an easier way to call the same process without having to repeat the same snippets within your code. You could just write everything from top to bottom repeating the same snippets or save those snippets in functions that you call when you need them again. It makes it easier to plug in where you need it but more importantly it allows you to make a change in one place (the function) that affects everything using that function.

I’ll use a simple example to demonstrate. Let’s say you want to loop through a csv and change the values in column A so that all the numbers are given leading zeroes so that all values have 3 places e.g. 001, 002, 003,... etc. You could write the code that makes that change in the loop and that’s fine.

But now you want to do the same thing to column B. Since you don’t have a function, you have to write that same snippet but for column B instead. And you’d have to do the same for column C as well. 

Well if you had a function that contained that snippet and took a column as an argument then you wouldn’t need to copy the whole thing, you’d just call the function twice; once for column A and once for column B and for any other columns. 

I hope that helps. Sometimes it’s hard to grasp these paradigms at first."

My first attempt at python was a discord bot for a guild I'm in. At first I just wanted to see if I could make one, first thing it done was say hi to new people.. Now it has a command that pulls covid19 data from an api, and then sends it to the discord. It has a mini casino where users can bet virtual money on games like black jack, roulette and so on. It also has a joke api that when triggered calls a joke api and sends the returned data to the discord.

The first one is ""takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given"" and we are dealing with a method on a class instance. Now this kind of thing comes up when something was expecting self or wasn't expecting self and self gets bound to the method incorrectly.

The second one is the name of the function `wrapper`. Your code doesn't have any function named `wrapper` and the code throwing the traceback doesn't have any code named `wrapper`: https://github.com/scikit-optimize/scikit-optimize/blob/8caf37d/skopt/optimizer/base.py

So where is wrapper coming from? Well it's coming from `use_named_args`: https://github.com/scikit-optimize/scikit-optimize/blob/8caf37d/skopt/utils.py#L731

This is creating a new function on your method that is not expecting to later be bound with `self`.

I think you would need to write your own `use_named_args` e.g. `use_named_args_method` where `wrapper` had the signature `wrapper(self, x)` and it passed this self to func e.g. `func(self, **arg_dict)`."

2020-06-21 03:21:27,mattno5ss,"I knew nothing of Python when I first started. So, there was definitely a lot of searching the internet for ways to use Python to complete this.  What I found was that if you can describe exactly what you want to do, piece-by-piece, then you can search one piece at a time for packages needed for that piece. As you search and learn, you may even come across a package that can accomplish multiple pieces for you. Finally, you can put all those pieces together to complete your puzzle (project).

&amp;nbsp;

Here are some of the searches I used along the way...

* ""python GUI"" - gave plenty of options such as PySide2, Tkinter, Kivy, PySimpleGUI, and wxPython. I chose PySide2 since it includes Qt Designer to create GUIs visually, which made it easy to jump into making a GUI.

* ""python download files from website"" - resulted in uses of modules called requests and urllib.request to download files with a given url. However, I knew I wouldn't always know the exact urls, so I searched the following...

* ""python get urls from website"" - this search led me to web scraping options like BeautifulSoup. This let me pull the required urls directly from the website's HTML.

* ""python pdf to image"" - resulted in pdf2image (requires poppler), so at first I used that for pdf to jpeg conversion.

* ""python image editing"" - resulted in Pillow (PIL), which seems really popular for image manipulation with Python, but after using that, I realized that I couldn't use it to create 24-bit grayscale bmp files (only 8-bit). So, it almost fit my needs, so I searched the following...

* ""python image editing Pillow alternatives"" - I looked through plenty of links from this search and stumbled upon the ImageMagick binding called Wand, and it could save 24-bit grayscale bmp images.

&amp;nbsp;

After working with Wand, I noticed it could also work with pdf images if I installed Ghostscript as well. So, I ended up ditching pdf2image and just used Wand to go from pdf to exactly what I needed.

Of course, there were plenty of other searches for things like how to search directories for certain file types, creating directories, and other uses of the os and pathlib modules. Then even more searches for using all of the specific modules I ended up needing for my project. Not to mention, reading a ton of official documentation that's available for those modules for things like tutorials, examples, and syntax.

It may seem never ending, but you'll be learning along the way, so it's never wasted time."

This is a contradiction. ""Hash"" very much does not mean ""unique"".

A hash function maps an infinite space (a in: any key you can imagine) to another space that is limited (eg. 32 bits of a key). This means that uniqueness is impossible, since you are bound to have at least 2 distinct input values that map to one value of hash function.  


Hash and set are O(1) on avarage, but can easily degrade to at least O(n), depending on the implementation."

I am myself coming from C++ background, so I too am not confident about Pythonic ways of doing things, as I still think in terms of index positions and arrays

here is my approach, feel free to change the logic if I have made a mistake.

Others, please do suggest efficient ways of doing this.

My Approach  
Iterate over first list, and then in that, iterate over second list.  
so the complexity of this problem is m\*n (where m, n is number of entries in both lists)  
then select only matching index positions using if statement  
then write desired logic  


    A = [0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1]
    B = [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1]

A better solution is to modify the list of all\_lines to get rid of each one as you check it against the other lines.  When the all\_lines list has been emptied you can end the recursion.

2020-06-20 22:28:24,FruscianteDebutante,"Reminds me a lot about my old roommate. Constantly talking about doing tutorials and reading and learning but never buildingb anything.

What is programming? It's commanding a machine to do your bidding. A machine that can have a clock that goes a billion times per second, and has access to many peripherals and communication methods. Perhaps multiple processors, and a large chunk of memory to keep track of things. These are all specifically in regards to a workstation, as you're talking about python you won't worry about more constrained hosts.

""I can't create anything"" just means you haven't started putting your foot forward. I've mainly used python as a tool for me as an engineer. I created C array generators, file locators, key word searches, simulations, and machine learning algs. But it can literally do anything. Build a game, a website, a scraper, a GUI that connects to a server that interacts with devices in your house. On and on and on and on.

I've seen this same post or sentiment dozens of times. You don't need to just do tutorials to ""learn python"". After you learn basic syntax, you need to go off and do something thatll help you or somebody else, or make something that interacts with a hobby or interest of yours. And guess what, you won't get it done right in your first go. You're gonna look things up, and fix a lot of bugs. And that's when you really begin your big next phase of growing. And that shit doesn't stop.

So stop thinking about it linearly, because there's no linear progression for this."

Once you know the basic si tax, my best advice to develop in this stage (with the aim to learn) is to start with something easy and improve it as you consider.

Example:
-	create a vector of random numbers, length 10
-	 sort this vector ascending 
-	add a number to the end when you press a key
-	sort it again (at this point you can think if there is a better way than adding to the end)
-	ask the user to introduce a number and add it and sort again
-	you can create another vector, sorted descending
-	play with the interface and what you show to the user (console? GUI?)
-	etc.

summary: think about what you can create, and improve it!

I think the best way to learn is through playing. [LEGO Foundation has a great research focused on this](https://www.legofoundation.com/en/learn-how/knowledge-base/what-we-mean-by-learning-through-play/) and can be used for coding introduction at all ages."

2020-06-20 22:06:06,johninbigd,"I think you're misunderstanding how `for` loops work in Python. They are different from other programming languages. A `for` loop in Python probably should have been called `foreach` because of the way it operates. It's a way of saying ""for each thing in this group of things, do something"". For example:

    fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'grape', 'cherry']
    for fruit in fruits:
        print(fruit)

What this does is iterates through the list called `fruits`, one item at a time, and it assigns that item to the variable `fruit`. I could have used anything as a variable name, but I chose `fruit` for clarity. I could have done this:

    x = ['apple', 'banana', 'grape', 'cherry']
    for y in x:
        print(y)
    
Those are identical in operation, but the first one is far more clear. There is nothing special about the variable names. They could be anything, but it's wise to choose names that enhance clarity."

2020-06-20 21:51:51,primitive_screwhead,"""Why"" is because of historical reasons.  Python had dicts first, for a very long time.   People who wanted sets in the early often just used dicts (and ignored the values, using just the keys).

Eventually, Python 2.3 added a 'sets' module, and then in 2.4 they were added as their own type.

[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0218/#history](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0218/#history)

&amp;#x200B;

But, the dictionary had already established the use of '{}' as an empty dictionary, so sets didn't get their own empty literal token ( The use of '{-}' for an empty set, had been proposed).

[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0218/#set-notation](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0218/#set-notation)

The actual set syntax using brackets (ie {1, 2, 3}, instead of just set(1, 2, 3)), came later, in early Python 3, and was backported to Python 2.7."

Everything I’ve learned has built onto itself, but my real learning came when I started watching others code. It all started making sense. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve taken ideas and then thought through a problem to figure it out. I used to slap code together and hope something stuck.

I had imagined that raising an Exception as you describe would potentially stop the script executing but if there's a way to do this more elegantly then I would be very interested to hear.

3. Thanks for the point on context managers - I have done quite a bit of reading on this and will implement.

4. I know that it's standard to use POST to modify something in an API but is there actually a benefit to this in this context - or just good practice

5. I put so much in except because of point 2 (ie if it failed I wanted it to do so silently without complaining or messing up execution of the overall script)

2020-06-20 19:33:38,Neighm,"&gt;How does python know when i type 'letter' that it automatically knows that i want to count the letters, even tho letter is not defined in code??

It doesn't know. Calling it ""letter"" is just good coding. The program would work exactly the same (try it!) If you changed ""letter"" to ""number"", or ""potato"", or ""space_shuttle_9573"" everywhere in the for loop.

So how does it know you want to iterate through letters? Because you told it you want to iterate through a **string**. Strings are defined with an iteration method that goes character by character. 

Similarly if you have a list called ""words"" and you write ""for  word in words"", then it will return one elements from the list at a time because that's how it iterates through any list. The code would work identically if the list of words was called ""dark_blue"" and your loop was written ""for pink in dark_blue"". Python just sees this as an instruction to iterate through a list, assigning each worked in turn to a variable whose name (""pink"") means nothing to the interpreter 

The reason it often looks like Python understands is because good programmers use meaningful variable names to make the code easier to understand for humans, which is why you're more likely to see ""for letter in word_string"" than ""for tickling in sympathy"". Python understands both to be the same, just with different arbitrary labels."

2020-06-20 19:24:12,kyber,"Variables in Python don't have values, but references to Python objects, that is some implementation specific way for Python to know where an object is held in memory.

When you define a function, you (optionally) define parameters. These are essentially variables used only within that function. When the function is called, arguments are provided that map 1:1 with the parameters (in the same order). That is, the object reference of the first argument is assigned to the first parameter, and so on.

The arguments will consist of any combination of:

* variable - i.e. a reference to an object
* an expression - perhaps another function call - that will resolve to a literal object or reference to an object
* a literal object, like a ""string""

The names in parameters and arguments don't need to match, but it is good to make them relatable in the human language of the developers concerned to avoid confusion. Consider the problems of the below:

    def f(two, three, four):
        return two + three * four


    one = 2
    two = 5
    three = 4

    print(f(three, two, one))

the above will print 14. This might take you a while to see. It is the POSITION order of parameters and arguments that are matched (there are options to specify the parameter names in the call, but let's not go there).

Some objects, like tuples, lists, strings, dictionaries, are iterable containers / sequences (actually, a collection of references to objects). Iterable means you can step through it.

A `for` loop exploits the method every iterable has to be repeatedly asked for its next item, generating an *exception* when all the items are exhausted, which the mechanism of the `for` loop is waiting for to know it should finish.

On each iteration of the `for` loop, the variable is assigned the reference to each successive object returned by the source objects iteration method. (A `for` loop can assign multiple variables when the object reference returned on each iteration is to an object itself containing more than one element - this is called *unpacking*.)"

For instance, in your user_input() function, append item and price to the lists (look at the append() method for lists) and then return the lists at the end of your function.
Now you do want to sort data, python has inbuilt sorting functions : sorting() and sort() that you can look into."

2020-06-20 18:38:47,PuffleDunk,"I don't know about data sciences specifically, as it relates to OOP programming. But in general Python takes a practical approach. I.e. use OOP when it makes your code simpler and cleaner.

I find I use OOP in a much more limited way than I used to. I make lots of pure data objects, but many fewer classes with methods. Perhaps I've evolved more toward a functional approach, where functions convert one kind of object to another, rather than having class methods to mutate the object.

If that's TMI, I'd just suggest learning OOP, but introducing it into your code more slowly, on an as-needed basis.

If you want to share code between computers you can save the env config ( if your using anaconda)

2020-06-20 18:11:55,ElderBlade,"Work on a project you find interesting and perhaps automate some part of your life. 

When I first started learning Python, I came into it already having a project in mind. The project was to completely automate my expense reports as a consultant. This was something that seemed possible, but I had no idea where to start. I signed up for a course on Udemy for like $10, and started learning the basics. 

As I learned the basics, I started researching how I could automate my expense reports. I broke it down by how it would work conceptually. First, how does it retrieve my email receipts from my google account? Well there’s a google api for interacting with email (sending, deleting, and reading). So I had to learn the google api and how emails work. 

Many hours later, ok, got the emails. How do I parse the information from them? I found a python Library called BeautifulSoup4 that parses html, so I had to learn that library and figure out how to parse emails. In some cases I only needed specific parts of an html tag, so I learned regular expressions. 

Next how do I convert the email to pdf? This was the hardest thing to figure out because there’s no python library that does this. But after enough research, I found a python wrapper for a C command line tool that converts html to pdf called wkhtmltopdf. Some emails had the receipt in a PDF attachment instead, so I had to figure out how to download the attachment instead and parse a PDF document. 

So step by step I eventually wrote an 800 line script that did my entire expense report for me. What took me 30-45 minutes every pay period was reduced to less than one minute. And I learned a ton of python libraries and their use cases. 

The class got boring, but the project always kept me engaged. You gotta pick a project no matter how daunting and just go for it."

If you have a video running on a website, you can turn it into a floating window and view it while running other applications

If you like customisablity, then you have so many options. Tabs can be put anywhere top, right, left, bottom. Start page allows you to click on websites that you have setup for quick access and you can put any icon of your choice for that, even gifs.

I just started my first real job (that involves coding) recently and was also a bit intimidated but it turned out to be much easier than what you might think from seeing an already written code in action. Here are just a few reasons why it wont be as bad as you're expecting (from my experience) :

1. When your boss/supervisor/client gives you this task, they will be very clear about what they want and what it has to do. If anything is unclear, you will ofc ask questions to clarify and make sure your goal is clear. Once you have a direction, it will be much easier to imagine what this code will be like and start writing it.

2. You will probably start working with other people's code to begin with anyway. You can learn from this and will have examples to follow and  eventually feel more comfortable with writing your own code when it comes time for it. 

3. Even when writing a whole code by yourself, I'm pretty sure *most* people are just copying and adapting bits of code they find on forums and websites online. There is almost always someone who has tried to do what you are doing before and so this means you won't really ever be writing a whole code by yourself anyway. 

4. If you break the task down into steps or chunks with a specific purpose, you can focus on just getting each part to function. This will make it seem a whole lot less like such a big and intimidating thing. (this applies to most difficult things in life)

I promise you, imagining doing a difficult thing is almost always harder than actually doing it! You will be fine, don't worry. 😊👍"
