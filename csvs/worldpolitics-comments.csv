It seems China ingratiated and bought it‚Äôs way into the Democratic minded, the Russians went the Republican route as they are not fettered with atheism and a central tenet.

China certainly seems to be acting as if the US is in it‚Äôs final days. Regardless of the source theory of covid19, with the schisms in America being severely agitated, I doubt they can pull through. 

China ensured the infection was widespread in America and Russia is ensuring there is contention on every aspect. Masks, lockdowns, white supremacy, all generating passion and extremism and I‚Äôm guessing the Russians aren‚Äôt trying to smooth those over.

So yes, China and Russia have identified their interests and new spheres of influence, and are absolutely working to bring down the American empire with finality. 

We‚Äôre in trouble here in Canada too. Scary stuff."

It‚Äôs basically when you call somebody stupid instead of attacking their logic. In fact it‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs preventing me from calling you a dumb ass. Lol just because I didn‚Äôt mention that the police chief is appointed by the mayor doesn‚Äôt mean you should assume I am as stupid as you. If you need proof I‚Äôve watched psych. Lol . 

Next to what you said about certain urban areas having higher concentrations of protests. That‚Äôs a given. Bigger city equals more people which statistically means more cases of police brutality if you measuring it in a police brutality vs overall police encounters ratio. No wonder denser areas have more protests.

Next on I my supposed religious argument. Lol I couldn‚Äôt care less about religion I am just saying in terms of who I would rather go to hell with it‚Äôs definitely not trump. 

Next on prosecution and Chicago. To say that there weren‚Äôt people that were super racist in the Democratic Party is simply not true. A lot of people were racist back then. The argument should then become who is doing THE MOST to make sure we stop police brutality. I can admit that Chicago still has tons of problems to this day but I‚Äôd rather vote in a candidate other than Donald Duck who is actually trying to resolve issues then inflame them? Did you hear about the bill in Congress made widespread policing changes? No? Oh wait that‚Äôs because it died in the Republican senate a group of old men bent on keeping their price late to themselves."

There is nothing unreasonable about telling you that your doubt about who appoints the Chief of Police means you don't know what you are talking about.

What is unreasonable is getting offended like you do know what you are talking about.

The Chief Of Police is appointed by the Mayor, and signed off on by the City Council. *All of which* are democrats in nearly every city where BLM went out and looted and burned buildings and are constantly protesting.

In the case of Chicago - it's literally been since 1931.

&gt; then great sign me up to go to hell

I didn't make it some kind of religious thing, buddy. Enjoy being locked down by your Democrat overlords, and being terrified of a flu that is about 3 times worse than normal, and really only kills people over 70 who have been in and out of hospitals for the last 10 years with some kind of pre-existing condition.

You can accept the Democrats and Media constant narrative that you need to live in fear in a bubble if you want to.

&gt;Also tell me, who is not prosecuting police officers?

Usually the DA. Depending on where you are it changes, but that is usually an ellected position... and usually a Democrat if you are in one of these big blue cities in a big blue state.

Do you really think the Union is the one that prosecutes? Or somehow a Republican?

I don't think it makes you evil if you want to vote democrat and live in a bubble, buddy. I do think it makes you wrong.

I don't think it makes you evil if you don't understand how the local government works, buddy. I do think it makes you wrong when you blame a group that has nothing to do with the way the local government works.

I agree that Police Unions don't help. But really they only control the defense, not the prosecution."

LOL. The Mayor appoints the Chief of police, and the legislature creates the laws they follow.

The thing you are ignoring is that the people you blame, Republicans or Trump, literally have had nothing to do with the laws or who runs the police force since before you were born. Maybe before your parents were born. And if you live in Chicago, maybe before your grandparents were born."

In one of them, taking place during team Avatar's travels in the fire nation, Sokka wants to learn more about the fire nation military, so he enrolls under the disguise of ""Wang Fire"", or Sokka with a beard. He was almost shipped off to the frontlines, but managed to sneak away. 

The army caught him (still wearing his disguise), so he told them he tracked some infiltrators to a cave (where team avatar resided). He then ""heroically sacrificed himself"" battling the ""infiltrators"", upon which the cave collapses (through earthbending). He and the rest of team Avatar get away through another exit, but the fire nation soldiers didn't know this. The above scene then takes place."

That was from when they infiltrated the Fire Nation on their way to meet up with the others for operation Black Sun. Aang got dragged to Fire Nation school by officials because the clothes he stole to blend in were actually a school uniform. He got in trouble and Sokka and Katara wore disguises and pretended to be husband and wife to go pick him up from the principal's office. The picture and name were Sakka's disguise.

So when I think critically on the issue at hand, I choose not to be offended at something so ridiculous and rather join in on the joke myself, rendering TRUE racism powerless at least in my own personal life."

It is the concept of a wrong being committed and thus a reacting with a wrong being done to somebody else to balance it. Justice, in its perfection, only ensures there are no winners."

Here is Mueller himself [claiming that he had no evidence.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woviFQD7Qrs) You know trump illegally paid her? You just magically know it. No evidence needed. Even though [she herself came out and said it never happened?](https://dailycaller.com/2018/01/12/trump-lawyer-releases-letter-from-porn-star-denying-affair-with-potus/)  The State Supreme Court Justice Saliann Scarpulla, wrote in a [court order](https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=tOMnNab_PLUS_PiNjvAeFP7v54A==) that the $2.8 million donated to the Trump Foundation ‚Äúwas used for Mr. Trump‚Äôs political campaign and disbursed by Mr. Trump‚Äôs campaign staff, rather than by the Foundation,‚Äù in violation of state law. However, she acknowledged that ‚Äúthe Funds did ultimately reach their intended destinations, i.e., charitable organizations supporting veterans.‚Äù Records [obtained](https://web.archive.org/web/20190110001949/https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/ex_22.pdf) by the state show donations totaling $2.825 million were given to 34 veterans organizations between January 2016 and June 2016. So, it‚Äôs false to claim that Trump ‚Äústole‚Äù the money and that ‚Äúnone of the veterans groups that were supposed to get the money got a single dime.‚Äù

We know Trump illegally paid a porn star money from campaign funds because Michael Cohen kept the canceled checks. We know that Trump used a cancer charity as a slush fund because he had to pay punitive damages. Likewise, he had to pay punitive damages for fraud in the Trump University scam. Giuliani is going to be indicted...joining his previous attorney in jail. Trump's campaign manager is in prison. Michael Flynn was caught on wiretap committing federal crimes and pled guilty....twice. The state of New York is investigating Trump for tax fraud. Roger Stone is going to prison for acting as an intermediator between Trump and the Russians. Barr himself has committed flagrant obstruction of justice and is going to prison.

In December of 2017 that Donald Trump Jr. received special access to documents stolen by WikiLeaks on Sept. 4, 2016. However, Donald Trump Jr. actually was emailed about the documents on Sept. 14, 2016 ‚Äî a day after they were already available to the general public.

Repeatedly claimed that all [17 intelligence agencies](https://dailycaller.com/2017/07/09/the-media-perpetuated-a-clinton-lie-for-9-months-what-it-means-for-the-russia-narrative/) came to the same conclusion about Russian meddling. CNN‚Äôs claim is pure nonsense, as the Department of Energy, Department of the Treasury, and Drug Enforcement Agency, among others, would have no authority to make any assertions about Russian meddling in elections.

On June 6, 2017, reports that former FBI director James Comey would contradict President Donald Trump‚Äôs claim that he was not under investigation.

When the time came for Comey to release his opening statement for his congressional testimony, he actually ended up confirming Trump‚Äôs account.

In May of 2017 when Republicans were authoring a new health care bill, [CNN claimed](https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/04/health/pre-existing-condition-rape-domestic-violence-insurance/index.html)¬†that GOP changes to Obamacare could make rape and sexual assault pre-existing conditions.

Chris Cuomo inexplicably said in October of 2016 that possessing WikiLeaks stolen documents is ‚Äúillegal,‚Äù but insisted it‚Äôs ‚Äúdifferent for the media.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlso interesting is, remember, it‚Äôs illegal to possess these stolen documents. It‚Äôs different for the media. So everything you learn about this, you‚Äôre learning from us,‚Äù Cuomo said.

According to [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/10/17/remember-its-illegal-to-possess-wikileaks-clinton-emails-but-its-different-for-the-media-says-cnns-chris-cuomo/?utm_term=.daf4a474613d), it is not illegal to possess or distribute illegally obtained material so long as you were not involved in the original hack.

Denounced Trump‚Äôs claim in March of 2017 that former President Barack Obama was wiretapping phones in Trump Tower as a ‚Äú[flat-out lie](https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/05/politics/trump-doj-wiretap/index.html).‚Äù

Then, in September of 2017, CNN reported that the FBI had a wiretap on former campaign chairman Paul Manafort ‚Äî who has a residence in Trump Tower.

Claimed that only Democratic members of Congress gathered to pray before the 2017 Congressional Baseball Game ‚Äî the first game after House Majority Whip Steve Scalise was shot and nearly killed.

Remember way back when Trump was first elected, and they claimed he humiliated America by dumping fish food in the koi pond while meeting with Japan's Abe? You can easily find gifs and footage showing Abe dumped his first, and Trump just followed his example. Remember when they said a Trump supporter punched a woman a rally and the video had that strange white flash in the middle of it? Later on the full video came out and showed that the woman went to the Trump rally and started tasering an old man. She was punched to get her off him. The left loves to weaponize lies. It started way back then and hasn't stopped.

Why didn't a single one of your ""two dozen"" women seek help when they had his semen dripping from their lying cunts? Would have been easy to get DNA proof that way..."

Remember how even their families and friends who were mentioned in the victims stories claimed that the accusers were lying.

All you've shown me is another suspicious woman who for some reason had no interest in seeking help 20 years ago when she was raped, but now that her chances of having a democrat president slip away suddenly wants justice?

Give it 3 weeks. I bet she drops the case, claiming that the trauma of going to court is just too much to bare."

My grandma was in her kitchen and wanted to make supper for me and my grandpa. I said very energetically, "" I want piza* please!"" She smiled and told me to come into the kitchen. I was very confused at first, but when she said that both of us were gotta make it, i was bouncing off the walls, happy as a dog. I hurt myself trying to get the olives out of the cans, so instead of saying that my job was done, she put on a bandage and kissed it saying that these little cuts were proof that i try very hard and very kind. Being the 5 or 6 year old i was, i cried. I cried happy tears that I was happy and i was helping and took the compliments very well. We finished the pizza and i got to try the very first bite of pizza i could remember. It looked exactly like that pizza in the picture except more meat everywhere. 

To this day, homemade pizza with my grandma is my favorite. I miss going that with her, because of the pandemic. I love her so much.

But because he's a conservative, he believes the federal government is only meant to serve as backup for the states. Its the mayor's job to take action followed by the state, then finally the president. People protesting the lockdown vote Republican, true. But data also shows your twice as likely to get infected staying home. So, why should we lock down? His supporters are waving nazi flags? What are you talking about exactly? The confederate flag? Symbols change over time and can mean more than one thing. One example would be the Black lives matter protestors waving a flag with a snake being strangled that says ""we will tread."" The ""do not tread on me"" flag is a symbol meant to oppose tyranny. It literally means ""just leave me alone."" Why are BLM protesters strangling the snake and claiming they will act in tyranny? (Sidenote: I am not claiming they are nazi's, but the antifa and BLM flags are black and red, same color as the nazi's)"

And for adc position: don't play adc. If you really feel the need to get depressed, my favourite picks are Varus and Ezreal. And again, your favourite e-girls like Miss Fortune or Ash can also do the trick.

They are purposely manipulating the terms so now none of it makes any sense. So the new rules are you can attack the majority. What majority? Global or what? Not just Americans and Europeans use reddit it's a global app so who are they talking about? Did you know that white people are actually a global minority. So is reddit opening hate, and bigotry to African, Latin, and Asian people around the world? They are a private company I guess they can do what they want right?

At the opening dinner of the Osaka G-20 meeting in June 2019, with only interpreters present, Xi had explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang. According to our interpreter, Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which Trump thought was exactly the right thing to do. The National Security Council‚Äôs top Asia staffer, Matthew Pottinger, told me that Trump said something very similar during his November 2017 trip to China.* John Bolton

It‚Äôs funny that the government that is meant to try and prevent these issues failed it‚Äôs people so utterly and that people refused to follow guidelines so completely because of politics. It‚Äôs funny how these failures hurt people, ruins families, and kills those at risk. It‚Äôs funny how the healthcare system is such a failure that even if you survive it you go into debt. It‚Äôs funny how politicians are debating if anything should be done to help those who lost their jobs, many of which are permanent job losses, because it might affect their pocketbooks. The natural order would‚Äôve meant we don‚Äôt have medicine or healthcare at all and this would have been one of many plagues so don‚Äôt think your privilege and entitlement aren‚Äôt showing, science brought us to here and ignoring it killed people. But hey, maybe you don‚Äôt have anything to worry about because you have no friends or family, nothing to make your health at risk despite the healthiest individuals still dying from complications after, or a job that will be affected in any way, shape, or form. Or maybe you‚Äôll be protected by that big old shield of not caring, because that‚Äôs usually effective when avoiding problems."

&gt; All western mass media outlets are now shrieking about the story The New York Times first reported, citing zero evidence and naming zero sources, claiming intelligence says Russia paid out bounties to Taliban-linked fighters in Afghanistan for attacking the occupying forces of the US and its allies in Afghanistan. As of this writing, and probably forevermore, there have still been zero intelligence sources named and zero evidence provided for this claim.

Have we forgotten the lies the NYT told is about Iraq and the warrantless spying of every single American?

Have we forgotten the many lies our so-called ""intelligence"" agencies have told for decade after decade -- pure political lies to support militarism and wars?

Haven't we learned to demand verifiable evidence for any claim our evil gov't makes?"

My age, race, gender, nationality; all a blank slate. Only two things are known about me.  
I never let a target get away alive, and I only kill people who deserve it.   
Mob bosses hire me to take out their rivals, corrupt politicians sic me on their own in betrayals. People have tried to trick me before, but I always found out when they did, A notorious gang leader had hired me yesterday to take out a senator.   
He claimed that he was corrupt, and had taken a bribe and then double crossed him.   
He was lying, and when he went to bed that night, he never woke up again. I left his head outside the building for his underlings to find.   
The next day, I had another person who wanted to hire me.   
It wasn‚Äôt someone who I had ever heard of before.   
She wanted to meet at the museum, after closing hours of course.   
She was in the gift shop.   
I was holding a laser sight on her from across the room.   
‚ÄúWho do you want dead?‚Äù I asked with the speakers.   
It was easy to hack into them from the offices, and the locks were childishly easy to pick. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need for that,‚Äù She said, lifting her hands above her head.   
‚ÄúI hope to hire you, not face off with you.‚Äù   
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not known for being trusting,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúNow, you should tell me the target already. I‚Äôm not here for chit-chat.‚Äù   
‚ÄúHave you ever heard of Joseph White?‚Äù She asked.   
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kidding,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI doubt anyone hasn‚Äôt. He made a fortune in investment, and dedicated it and his life to helping others. He‚Äôs the world‚Äôs richest philanthropist.‚Äù   
‚ÄúNo, he‚Äôs human scum,‚Äù She said. ‚ÄúAnd I have proof.‚Äù   
She pointed to a file sitting on the nearby table, a piece of paper just barely poking out of the top.   
‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave this for you,‚Äù She said. ‚ÄúThe payoff will be two million dollars. That‚Äôs enough for you to live the rest of your life in comfort. I hope you decide to take the deal.‚Äù   


Two weeks later, I stood atop a tower looking through the scope of my rifle.   
The sights were trained perfectly on White‚Äôs chest.   
He had people in suits all around him, and that confirmed it.   
Nobody innocent had that many guards.   
I pulled the trigger, and he fell down a second later. His body tumbled out of his chair, and the people around him panicked.   
As I watched through the scope, I saw something that shocked me.   
He was moving, and the guards were pulling him to his feet as they clustered around him.   
He must have been wearing a Kevlar vest.   
I was prepared for this though.   
I had attached a line to the roof above him, and I used it now, sending myself sliding down.   
By the time I reached the roof, they had already escorted him inside.   
There was a helicopter on the roof, and as they emerged from a doorway they made their way towards it.   
I opened fire, and mowed down the entire group with a gun that had been loaded with armor piercing rounds.   
He was left standing by himself, and as he tried to run I pulled free a pistol and shot him through both kneecaps.   
I approached him carefully, gun pointed at his head.   
‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù He gasped in pain.   
‚ÄúI thought you only killed those who were evil.‚Äù ‚ÄúI am,‚Äù I replied.   
‚ÄúWhat did I do to deserve this?‚Äù He said, begging and crying. ‚ÄúWhat could justify this?‚Äù   
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs simple,‚Äù I said, pushing my glasses up my nose with a finger.   
‚ÄúYou did the one thing that nothing can redeem you from.‚Äù I pulled the trigger, and his brains scattered across the tiles.   
I looked down at him, a mixture of disgust and pity on my face. ‚ÄúYou forgot the sauce.‚Äù"

While I'm sure it's a great program for a lot of people. It caused normal insurance that I had to be unaffordable to me at the time and nothing to fall back on. It needs to be fixed instead of gotten rid of."

&gt;‚ÄúSenator Byrd reflects the transformative power of this nation,‚Äù stated NAACP President and CEO Benjamin Todd Jealous. ‚ÄúSenator Byrd went from being an active member of the KKK to a being a stalwart supporter of the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act and many other pieces of seminal legislation that advanced the civil rights and liberties of our country.

&gt;‚ÄúSenator Byrd came to consistently support the NAACP civil rights agenda, doing well on the NAACP Annual Civil Rights Report Card. He stood with us on many issues of crucial importance to our members from the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, the historic health care legislation of 2010 and his support for the Hate Crimes Prevention legislation,‚Äù stated Hilary O. Shelton, Director of the NAACP Washington Bureau and Senior Vice President for Advocacy and Policy. ‚ÄúSenator Byrd was a master of the Senate Rules, and helped strategize passage of legislation that helped millions of Americans. He will be sorely missed.‚Äù - [The Hill](https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/106189-naacp-mourns-byrds-death)"

The punitive separation of families (and the subsequent disappearance of children)  is all Trump. The Obama administration did not have a policy of separating families. 

Defending confederate statues (and white supremacists) long predates the current spate of demonstrations. 

And, due to the absolute bungling of the COVID response, the economic gains that maybe could have been attributed to trump have evaporated. Hardest hit? African Americans.

2020-06-29 23:55:20,antdgaf421,"Where are these ads? Ive sure never seen a trump ad with a swastika. It's not defending Confederate flags and statues, its taking measures to prevent that history from being erased and forgetting the lessons learned from that tragic era of american history. Furthermore, the order protecting statues isnt primarily for confederate statues, it protects all historical monuments as rioters were defacing and vandalizing places like the Lincoln Memorial, statues of union presidents like andrew jackson. Confederate monuments had already been being removed with no issue before this situation. I love how we have to misconstrue things to fit our narrative though. Outsourcing labor has been a major issue that has been devaluing the national labor force for decades, even Democrat presidents have admitted this(though not so callously). Not to mention the importation of cartel crime at the border states, which by the way, rose dramatically as democrats encouraged people to illegally cross the border a couple years ago. That issue about separating families and ""kids in cages"", wasnt an issue during the Obama administration. Even though the exact same thing was happening then. A lot of the illegal immigration detention center's were actually put into operation by the obama administration. Back to misconstruing things for the narrative. White supremacists are not even the largest demographic of trump supporters, theyre just one of the loudest. Then theres the little tid bit of reality where a lot of actual far right white nationalists actually despise trump because of his longstanding relations with the Jewish community. Oh the irony here. let's talk about that ""gross mischaracterization"". Inappropriately touching someone with no regard for how they feel about it(or their consent), could be referred to as fondling, groping, or even molestation. Especially when you do excessively creepy things like smell that person's hair. The icing on the cake here is that a lot of them were minors. Haha that televised blunder wasnt an isolated incident, either. There have been several complaints about Biden's inappropriate behavior, over the years, as well as the whole scandal with Tara Reed. As far as youre concerned that didnt happen though, because your left leaning messiahs of ""truth"" told you it didnt. Also gotta remind you that I dont exactly trump, since he is a shameless opportunistic capitalist, and he's likely not much better of a human being. I have no idea whether his personal beliefs align with bigotry or not but his actions as the president, are not consistent with someone who wishes to empower white supremacy. I mean, raising black communities out of the welfare dependence that democrat mayors and governors have kept them in, for several decades; is not something a white supremacist would do. Now that weve kicked out your regurgitated-overused-argument crutches, what else you got?"

My friends dad was a stud, and nice looking for a mid 50s man, but his wife was literally stunning (and was actually a little older than him). Like, one of those women that 21 yr olds would fuck in a heart beat. Married for over thirty years and probably the strongest and most realistic marriages I've ever seen.  She was a FLIRT, but was totally innocent about it.  Of course the men she was flirting with didn't see it that way. We were at a wedding once and I was sitting at the table with said friends dad, and we were just watching his wife flirt her way across the floor. I was kinda concerned and asked him how he felt about it. He grinned and responded, ""they may warm her up, but when you know that they're just making my job easier tonight it's kinda like they're just working for me"". Blew my mind and really helped me with jealousy and insecurity issues when I was a young man. Still chuckle at his confidence and amazing trust in his wife and marriage. 


I also have a suspicion that the dad was fucking hung and they had an insane sex life, which helps with the whole trust thing a bit, lol."

Anyone can be Hawaiian, as long as they come here to make Hawaii grow and not tear Hawaii down and use it for their own purpose. But you can only be born into Kanaka Maoli blood.

I'm the Kanaka, in this example.

You may as well ask your mom ""What have you done to improve black lives?""... assuming she isn't in government and has no control over anything.

And now... you are going to stand here and pretend the Democrats, who run every city into the ground - areas with giant black communities, brown communities, asian communities - have done something *for you*?

What? What did they do? Give you warzones and moved all manufacturing overseas to leave you to fight it out for barista jobs?

You are rioting and protesting over the application of laws that have been written by The Democrats, who have controlled your city for decades. All police conduct is controlled by Democrats who select the Police commander on down. Laws that the democrats write.

Republicans haven't had control since before you were born. How can you possibly blame Republicans and still vote Democrat?

90 years the democrats have run that city. 90. Your grandparents were probably not alive the last time the GOP had any power in Chicago.

2020-06-29 21:05:57,jormundr,Do you just furiously masturbate thinking about how clever you think you are?
2020-06-29 21:05:51,antdgaf421,"Maybe thats a question you should take up with the white house press secretary. I'm an advocate for actions over words. Hate to refer to something so overused as the Black unemployment rate and the First Step Act(a favorite go-to for supporters). A different angle on understanding why simple minded fringe white supremacists support him, boils down to his demeanor for simple wording and strongman rhetoric; something many Americans associate with golden age nostalgia, when presidents took hard stances and made efforts to make America appear strong. Many of these white supremacists associate the golden age of America with their own delusions of ""racial purity"". Adjacently, the last 3 presidents of the US have popularly made the nation look stupid or weak. Not to mention the Association of the right wing with authoritarianism. Its a faith based support system, similar to how you'll probably vote for a man who fondles underaged girls on national television because he is with the democratic party - the party youve always associated with ""power to the people"" even though areas under their jurisdiction see some of the highest poverty, unemployment rates, and welfare dependence. Property values and quality of life have fallen to all time lows, despite those areas receiving some of the highest infrastructure budgets. Meanwhile, ""Democrat"" officials enjoy the same lavish lifestyles as many hated republican officials. Its an absolute shitshow of misinformation and accusations. To be perfectly clear, I'm not even exactly a trump supporter. He is clearly a corporatist, among scumbag oligarchs. Though, we cant be fooled by the ""party of the people"" when all they do is exploit taxpayer funding and cater to lobbyists the same way republicans do. Again, I'm not a trump supporter, I'm a reality supporter."

Imagine if the entire world monitored your every move and rearranged the context of every mistake or misstep you made, to make you appear as some kind of evil bastard. Thats called gaslighting. The same thing you people make hollow accusations towards this guy for."

2020-06-29 20:24:01,gailson0192,Well I think it‚Äôs a bit optimistic at this point a conflict won‚Äôt break out. And wars don‚Äôt have to involve invasion although I wouldn‚Äôt put it past China. And I believe mutually assured destruction is not a deterrent when it comes to China who has a shit of citizens it doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about. There is no mutual assurance if your military is superior.
