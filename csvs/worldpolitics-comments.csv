The politicians from one political party who literally control all of the police forces in the cities where you protest and riot - The Democrats?

Nah... you don't think that at all. Somehow, you mean ""Republicans"" even though republicans have had no meaningful say on how your city and state are run since before you were born, college kid.

If we existed in a universe where 2+2=3, then the formula would be wrong. If the universe is a simulation, the laws could be changed to make 2+2=3. So you either have to admit that the formula is material, and therefore proven by the same logic as reality. Or it is abstract, and can therefore be changed by a theoretical simulation, which makes it a non-logical conclusion.

The fact that 2+2=4 is independent of any physical law, and is proven using formal logic without any reference to physical quantities. Experience is merely a demonstration of the truth of it, not a proof.

2020-06-25 13:42:19,quick00silver,"I think there is a comprehension gap between what I'm saying and what you are hearing.  I previously didn't say that ALL people at a Trump rally are racists.   I said that the rallies are well attended by racists.  The rest are enablers and tacit approvers of the racism, and deep  ethical, moral and intellectual incompetence coming from the stage.  Nor did I accuse all Conservatives of being racists.  There is a large number of thoughtful and decent conservatives in this country that abhor Trump and who have never supported him.  

Based on your responses so far, it's clear to me that you are incapable of nuanced thought and are responding reflexively because you think I'm calling you a racists because you consider yourself to be a conservative.  No.  I think you are either a racist or a racist enabler because you support Trump; A man who has a long and well documented history of pathological lying, corruption, immoral, racist behavior.  

You may object and feel offended that I'm lumping you in with bigots and credulous  idiots who either refuse to see, or worse, actually like those qualities about Trump.  But I'm not concerned about whether you're offended or not.  You have a choice.  You can be a conservative who does not support Trump, or you can be a MAGAT.  Two very different things.  Choose."

2020-06-25 12:35:21,EmperorRosa,"&gt;who merely looks at things from a logical point of view instead of blindly accepting things that may or may not be true

It's not logical to imagine some dream world created by extremely intelligent aliens. It's a Sci fi book. The most logical conclusion, is that reality exists. I'm not telling you to blindly accept that. Feel free to deny it, when you have actual evidence that an alternative exists. Until then, yes it is absolutely logical to accept reality exists. I'm not going to repeat myself. Read my arguments, and address them, or don't bother replying.

&gt;I'm saying you can't offer a single shred of remotely reliable evidence for that claim. Besides, even if an actual god told me it was true, how would I know it was a god and not a hallucination of some sort?

This is literally what I mean. You don't accept human forms of proof because they're not objective enough, and you wouldn't even accept a gods word as proof. So, what proof do you want? 

&gt;a proof is a purely logical progression from one true statement to another. As examples, the progression from the principle of mathematical induction to the fact that 2+2=4, or the progression from the formula for the area of triangle to the Pythagorean theorem

In the basis of your own beliefs, these things are untrue. Those mathematical formulas are invented by an external force, slave aliens, and as such, are untrue and cannot be ""proven"" unless you believe reality exists, as a foundation for them.

Your entire delusion here denies all proof, all mathematical formulas, all forms of physics. 

&gt;What you are attempting to offer is evidence from experience

Not at all. I spent a long time typing out the evidence, which you have chosen not to respond to.

2+2=4, because from experience, adding 2 things, to 2 things, makes 4 things. The pythagoras theorem is only logically correct, if it works in practise, through EXPERIENCE using it. Mathematics is absolutely proven from experience. It doesn't exist in the abstract, it exists in material reality. So to deny material reality, is to also deny that mathematical formula.  Your call. 

&gt;it is merely the conclusion of carefully examining reality from a logical perspective

According to you. You haven't examined anything, you simply believe that senses can be inaccurate. Luckily we have other scientific instruments to measure the things we can't see, and turn them in to signals we can. You have examined nothing, really. 

&gt;problem that has been raised by Descartes, Berkeley, Hume, Hegel, and numerous others.

Mostly idealists, who believe that our perception shapes reality. Again, interesting concept for a fiction novel, not particularly interesting or productive for philosophy."

2020-06-25 10:59:14,Woonachan,"Since  the beginnings of the universe, where time was merely a concept and  where there was an abyss of nothingness, many have asked the age old  question: ""are traps gay?"". Today, with our scientifical and  mathematical advancements, paired with the high intelligence and  logicallity of our species, the homosapiens, we will finally and  certainly be able to answer the ever longlasting question.

Firstly,  we must analyze what makes a person, or a pair of people ""gay"". From  the high logicallity of our species, we can easily determine this by  presenting the matter as a series of equations. In the equations below,  ""x"" is a representation of the gender ""male"" and ""y"" is a representation  of the gender ""female"", while the plus sign is a representation of  sexual intercourse and the result of the equation is the ""gayness"" of  the pair of homosapiens.

x + x = 100

From  this equation we can see that two males having intercourse is 100% gay.  We can then use this equation to solve for the gayness of one male.

2x = 100

x = 50

This  shows us that one male is 50% gay. Another equation can be used to  determine the ""gayness"" of two females having intercourse.

y + y = 0

We  can see from this equation that two females having intercourse is 0%  gay. This is because, we homosapiens have given 0% gayness another name,  called lesbianism. We can then, again, find the ""gayness"" of one female  by reaggaranging the equation, which - as a result - gives us 0%  gayness.

Now, since two variables  are found, we can then forumalte a new equation which gives us the  ""gayness"" of a male and a female having intercourse.

x + y = (unknown gayness)

Then, by substituting in the values for x and y, we can solve for the unknown gayness.

50 + 0 = 50

Therefore, we can conclude that the gayness of a male and female having intercourse is 50%.

However,  there is an unresolved problem with the ""gayness"" of two females having  intercourse. If you imagine a unit circle, you will know that the four  units of the unit circle on the x or y intercept is equal to:

0, 90, 180, 270, 360..... (degrees) (0=360)

or

0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2, 2pi...... (radians) (0=2pi)

If you replace these units with the percentage of gayness up to 100%, you will find:

0, 25, 50, 75, 100.... (gayness) (0=100)

From  this you can see that 0% gayness and 100% gayness is in the same spot  in the unit circle, suggesting that lesbianism is 100% gay. This  information will be useful later on.

Next,  we need to add the element of ""traps"" into our equations. By  definition, a trap is a crossdresser, who dresses up in the opposite  genders clothing to trick people into thinking that they are the  opposite gender. Traps are also usually feminine if they are born male,  and more masculine if born female.

From  this information, we can determine how to represent a trap as a  variable in an equation. Since traps are crossdressers and usually have  an abundance of hormones of the opposite gender, we can say that they  are both genders. This is represented as: xy.

However,  they are not actually half male and half female (which is actually  transgenderism). The gender they actually are should be more predominant  than the gender they are dressing to be. Since their birth gender is  more predominant, the variable representing traps will change. The ratio  of the femininity and masculinity of a trap is shown below:

                                Femininity : Masculinity   

Traps born male: 1 : 2 Traps bon female: 2 : 1

This allows us to formulate an accurate variable for a male and female trap:

Traps born male (Male trap) = x¬≤y

Traps born female (female trap) = y¬≤x

Now, since we know the values for x and y, we can determine the ""gayness"" of traps by substituting in the values.

Male trap = 50¬≤ \* 0

Male trap = 0% gay

Female trap = 0¬≤ \* 50

Female trap = 0% gay

These  results look shocking. However, there is a massive problem with it. The  unit circle analogy of lesbianism is not applied to this. If we apply  the unit circle analogy to the equation, the value of y will be 50  because:

y + y = 100

y = 50

Therefore if we substitute the correct value of y into the equation, it becomes:

Male trap = 50¬≤ \* 50

Male trap = 50¬≥

Male trap = 125000% gay

Female trap = 50¬≤ \* 50

Female trap = 50¬≥

Female trap = 125000% gay

From this, we can finally answer the age old question - are traps gay?

And the answer is, EXTREMELY GAY."

2020-06-25 09:00:25,yeeticus_deleticus_,"[Hey, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pok√©mon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pok√©mon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3""03' tall and 63.9 pounds. this means they're large enough to be able to handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there's no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll eyes, Captivate, Charm and Tail Whip along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it'd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pok√©mon comes close with this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat + high HP pool + Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more.  However, screw the female version. You get those same ol' two holes in literally everything else. The male Vappy is the real star of the show.  Those long slippery dicks; they have full mobility control and like a tentacle are the perfect ass filler for the ultimate in-deep reaching experience nothing else could possibly provide. Naturally lubed at all times due to their aquatic hydrodynamic nature, you can pull out anywhere to the side of the road or go into a public restroom at the beach; get each other aroused, and have the fuck of a lifetime. The extraordinary squishyness of the Vappy alone rubbing against you would be enough to lose yourself in pleasure as it simply mounts you. Let alone as that perfect tool of pleasure slips into you, it's ability to snake around your bends and its perfect length make it seem that a Vappy dick was made specifically for your booty. Enjoy the feeling of being completely filled while also being able to see it if you have a tight tummy.  And that's only the dick; due to having internal balls, they're much bigger and pack a lot more cream to load you up with, along with having muscles around them to make sure every drop comes out while also being a lot more powerful than any external balls could ever hope to achieve, giving you a deep, complete filling to rock your world to your literal core, and beyond.  There's still more though; due to having a thick, powerful tail connected from their back and front, that means all their fun stuff is on the front and easy to access. Meaning, if you were even comfortable with having your dick point backwards (takes some training), you can be fucked, while also fucking your Vappy at the same time! Meowth, that's fucking right!  But, but, but! There's still fucking more! Like, holy shit, male Vaps are the gods of fuck. While you're fucking your male Vappy, possibly while also being fucked by him, their booty is on their tail at the base, which is the thickest part, because that's where the biggest muscles are. This means that while your dick is in there, it's being fucking massaged, better than even a vag could achieve! Agh! It should be fucking illegal because how amazing male Vaps are for fuck!  Well guess what? That only covered you being a softy, wholesome fucker like me. That's right. There's. Even. Fucking. More! Say you like to be a little restrained: you don't need a Sylveon's feelers for that, or an Umbreon/Espeon's psychic powers, or Leafeon's vines. Vappies got that shit covered too! Did you even see that tail?! It's basically a boa constrictor. In a non-sexual sense, it's my favorite part of a Vappy. It's basically their main part about them. But, if you want them to, it can be a super useful tool to enhance your knotty experience with them. Despite the slippyness, you won't be going anywhere if the Vappy wraps you up in that thing.  Are you a super kinkster? Do you like pure fantasy fetishes that aren't possible IRL? Such as, say, soft vore? Well guess fucking what. It just became possible! They can be solid as they pass your lips (past where your eyes can see them) and turn into water as they enter you, allowing them to fit perfectly, 'cuz nothing fits into any spot more perfectly than water, except air like a ghost type. But who wants to do knotty shit with air? You can't feel it unless it's moving; you can always feel liquids. Speaking of liquids, even if you're a weirdo who likes digestion, don't worry about killing them with absorption. Eventually, they'll come back out and be able to reform like nothing happened. Speaking of hurting them, if you get too rough, or you're a horrible abusive asshole to them on purpose for your own pleasure (QnQ), they can just turn to water and reform back to their completely unscathed body, making scars or missing pieces a thing of the past!  I would love to say there's even more you can do with them, but the possibilities are damn near endless. Use your imagination. But if you get one, you better show this god of fuck the respect it deserves. Umbreons maybe my favorite but, damn, Vappies really want to get that top spot from me. It's a really close call.](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)"

So take the opinions of an old stoner drug dealer that's done time and is barred from voting or owning a gun with a grain of salt. 

Personally, I do not trust anyone who spent a good 2 decades of their life getting countless people addicted to drugs and ruining many lives in the process.

In terms of Occam's Razor, the simplest theory that requires the least assumptions is that of Hume: the only thing that exists are your experiences. Those are really the only thing that we can be certain of its existence. Anything else requires assumptions without evidence.

I'm not saying you should reject your belief, but merely recognize that it is merely one of multiple possibilities, all equally likely."

2020-06-25 04:00:24,og_math_memes,"Again, you greatly misunderstand me. I'm not ""some overhyped kid who thinks science is the status quo and it would be totally cool if science was wrong,"" I'm a math/electrical engineering double major who merely looks at things from a logical point of view instead of blindly accepting things that may or may not be true. Do I think science is correct? Yes. Do I recognize that I have absolutely no logical reason to believe that? Also yes. 

And no, my basis for proof is not so high, it's just that I actually care about whether things are reliable sources of evidence, which you seem to just accept. I'm not merely saying you can't *prove* that physical reality exists, I'm saying you can't offer a *single* shred of remotely reliable evidence for that claim. Besides, even if an actual god told me it was true, how would I know it was a god and not a hallucination of some sort?

In terms of *proof*, a proof is a purely logical progression from one true statement to another. As examples, the progression from the principle of mathematical induction to the fact that 2+2=4, or the progression from the formula for the area of triangle to the Pythagorean theorem. What you are attempting to offer is evidence from experience, which is literally trying to prove the senses lead to true things by using the senses. 

Again, you're deploying arguments that make anyone who has studied any level at all of philosophy (or formal logic) want to throw something. I'm honestly quite astonished that you can't see how circular your logic is.

&gt;Ah yes, ""assuming"" on the basis of empirical, logical, and scientific evidence.

You're literally demonstrating my point. The fact that you are referencing empirical, scientific evidence means you have already assumed what you were using the evidence to show. You are *not* making a logical argument, you are referencing experience. If you want to make a purely logical argument then I'll listen, but your attempts to show experience is reliable by merely relying on experience is laughable.

&gt;You're knee deep in delusions because you think it's clever, or creative.

I know full well it is neither clever nor creative, it is merely the conclusion of carefully examining reality from a logical perspective. It is certainly not creative because it is a well-known philosophical problem that has been raised by Descartes, Berkeley, Hume, Hegel, and numerous others."

It works well enough if you only ever deal with people in the country. But business is international and so remembering Japan is GMT+9 is easier than Googling JST every time. Rinse and repeat for every international time zone Americans might have to interact with.

2020-06-25 02:37:46,Curiosidad_,"You did not provide any evidence contrary to what I said. The reason I mentioned trump was that that study was published in 2017. Also the trump administration has put a concerted and organized effort into making it seem like men, particularly white men are an oppressed group when they are clearly not. Men rarely get raped compared to women for two reasons. 

One is cultural. There is no culture that makes it seem okay for women to rape men. A video just came out of Joey Diaz bragging about raping women on Joe Rogan‚Äôs podcast from less than 10 years ago. Sadly that podcast has a very devoted and large fan base, which has uniformly defended that incident. You will never see an interview of some female comedian bragging about sexually men. Not to mention thousands of years of women being seen as a possessions. It‚Äôs not like you can erase the legacy of that in 100 years. 

Trump himself had bragged about it more than once. It‚Äôs unlikely someone like Hillary Clinton ever raped someone, and then bragged about it. There are a ton of recent studies regarding male sexual assault, and most of them never show men getting sexually assaulted even through coercion at a rate anywhere near the rate women endure. And most studies show rates which are certainly far below the rates in the article you cited. Your personal bias is clearly clouding how you feel about this pal. I have no personal bias On this. 

I‚Äôm a man. I have NEVER in my 4 years of college, my time in highschool, and after ever had a male confess to me that they had been sexually assaulted. I have had literally dozens of women in that same span tell me they had been. Not to mention how many of those men I had heard describe things they did, which were clearly problematic.

Gtfo with your meninist bullshit. Don‚Äôt just read things that back up your pre-existing beliefs. Of course domestic violence happens to straight men but to act like it‚Äôs a legitimately prevalent issue is a joke


The CDC website right now says 1:38 men experiences full or attempted rape in their life time 

Rain says 1/33 

The NISVS say 4.8% of men have dealt with forced penetration and 6 percent have dealt with coercion. Or 7% have been raped by a female partner according to their 2014 info. And those numbers likely overlap a lot. Also according to them, 1/4 of the rapes that men endure happen when they are under 10 which is child molesting.


The part of the study that stemple cited as the most extreme example of men being sexually coerced, was so broad it defined unwanted sex  as unwanted sex compelled by verbal pressure, nagging, and begging. Begging and nagging does not equate to rape. I think everyone 100% of people has had a partner nag or beg them for sex. I think you can nag someone until it crosses a line but to say that those equate to rape is ridiculous. Not to mention the size of that part of the study was 284. Which is far too small to be considered conclusive."

2020-06-25 01:51:06,EmperorRosa,"&gt; yet you don't seem to understand that if ""my theory"" was correct then science and the material world do not actually exist.

Sorry, perhaps I used the incorrect words. ""Theory"" implies there is some degree of evidence behind it. What I meant was ""delusion"".

&gt;but my entire point is that you're merely assuming that those things are true and the only evidence you have that is by assuming they're true. 

Ah yes, ""assuming"", on the basis of empirical, logical, and scientific evidence. You don't understand what an assumption is. You're some overhyped kid who thinks science is the status quo and it would be totally cool if science was wrong. You're knee deep in delusions because you think it's clever, or creative. It would be if you were writing a book.

&gt; In order to show that reality exists, you can't just assume it does and use that assumption to prove it. 

There is nothing to show. According to all common human forms of ""proving"" something, reality exists. It's like you asking me to ""prove"" ladybirds are a thing. Your argument here rests on the idea that all human forms of proof have a possibility of being unobjective, no?

&gt;Any reference to science, the senses, or the physical world cannot be trusted until it has already been established that the physical world exists, and you have been unable to do so.

Then you don't have any proof for literally anything. Your basis for ""proof"" is so high, that you'd only believe it if an actual God told you it was true. Even then you'd be a skeptic. It's healthy to be a skeptic, it's not healthy to engage yourself in a grand delusion and pretend you're on to something big with no evidence. 

Your narrative here is that you want proof, but that proof can't come from literally any source other than an objective god. So, ultimately, you don't want proof, you want someone to tell you that you're clever for denying material proof because you think the very semantics of the word are wrong."

Every time I make a point you say something to the effect of ""reality exists so that can't be true"" or ""that's false because it's unsupported by science"" but my entire point is that you're merely assuming that those things are true and the only evidence you have that is *by assuming they're true*. Your logic is entirely circular on every single point you've made. You're just saying I'm wrong because you've already assumed the opposite conclusion is true. In order to show that reality exists, you can't just assume it does and use that assumption to prove it. You must not make an assumption either way and then show that there is a reason to believe that it does.

Any reference to science, the senses, or the physical world cannot be trusted until it has already been established that the physical world exists, and you have been unable to do so.

&gt;One is a childish fantasy that rests purely on imagination of something larger than ourselves.

Ironically that sounds exactly like your position. You are the one postulating that the physical world exists.

You don't seem to be able to understand that every single point you're making rests on exactly the idea that I'm saying could be false. For example you say the human brain is not capable of producing such complex experiences, yet the very thing I'm proposing is that the human brain does not exist. The only reason you believe brains exist is through the senses, which as I have shown numerous times are not necessarily reliable."

2020-06-25 01:04:01,EmperorRosa,"&gt; I was saying that any empirical/observable evidence is impossible, because it would not be evidence. It would be exactly the same as saying movies are real because you can observe them.

A movie is real, it has physical substance. The people in it are not real. The fact that you can determine the difference between a movie and a human, is emprical evidence that both are real, but not comparable.

&gt;Think about it this way: why do you trust the senses? Because you believe there is a real physical world. Why do you believe there is a real physical world? Because you trust the senses. 

There is nothing to ""trust"", senses are not an entity, they are an evolutionary method of observing the world through various lenses. That is an objective fact.

&gt;Yes I know about Russell's Teapot, and that's exactly why the burden of proof is on you. You're the one postulating the existence of a massive chunk of reality

I'm not postulating anything, reality is there. If you wish to disprove that, that is on you. It empirically exists, because the definition of ""empirical"" is ""observable"". It is tactile. What's more, it's observable when a human is not looking at it, as observed with recording software, so we do not invent it.

If it were a reality created by a being, it would still be real, for all intents and purposes.

&gt;but there is also no logical or rational reason for it to be true that physical reality exists

I have explained on multiple occasions, which you haven't addressed.

&gt;It could be that your experiences are all that exist. You have a predetermined set of experiences, and nothing else exists. 

The human brain as we know it, is not capable of imagining billions of complex human decisions and chains of logic. Ergo that cannot possibly be an individual construct.

&gt;There are other continuous sets of experiences we have that do not point to something real per se. One example is movies. A possibility is that reality is a preprogrammed ""movie"" that plays in your mind 

Then we would not have the capability to make choices. The concept of free will, imagined or not, would be pointless.

&gt;There could be another being giving us these experiences... Since this being would not have the physical limitations we observe, we have no idea what such a being is capable of

We can daydream all we like about the objectivity of our methods of what we consider ""real"". The fact is, we can empirically, scientifically, logically, and rationally determine, that reality is very much not a simulation. This might not be a fully objective method of detemrining this, but then, we have no objective way of determining whether gravity exists, or evolution. That doesn't mean we should consider any other possibility, unless evidence is presented. The fact is, logically, and empirically, gravitational theory is the best conclusion to what we observe, and some kind of space-god smashing rocks together for fun, is not particularly logical, nor does it have any evidence for it.

The metaphysical question of whether the scientific method is ""fully"" objective is pointless. The scientific method does not seek to find objective facts, but extremely likely ones, until further evidence comes about. Your silly childish daydream here, does not have any evidence. Ergo, like Russells Teapot, it is not worth considering.

 &gt; if you didn't have any senses, would you believe in physical reality? 

I refuse to answer questions with unrealistic scenarios. If I didn't have senses, I wouldn't be alive, since life is literally determined by senses and signals.

&gt;In the end you are choosing to blindly accept the senses with no reason to do so

Several reasons to do so. On a purely rational level, is it more likely that we exist as a simulated process of billions of complex mechanisms and movements of atoms that we can't even begin to comprehend, or is it more likely that this is simply reality, which is precisely why it is so complex? One is reasonable and describable. One is a childish fantasy that rests purely on imagination of something larger than ourselves. Interesting, but far less logical. So, thats the rational reason to accept reality.

On an empirical level, the very definition of the word is ""OBSERVATION"", so again, that is aprime reason to accept reality.

From a scientific standpoint, the counter-point offered here by you is quite easily dismissed as having little material evidence, like, even less than flat earthers. Your theory here rests solely in your imagination, and not on the material plane.

So, as you can see, many reasons to accept reality. Not very many to accept delusion."

2020-06-25 00:49:52,1040900073,"military time, or what many country's know as ""Time"" is very easy to read. once it gets past 12:00 pm or noon you can just forget about the first number and just subtract the second one by two. For example, let's say the clock says 16:12. The first thing you do is just forget about the 1 in front. now it says 6:12. from there you just subtract that 6 by 2 and BAM! it suddenly says 4:12, which is a  format of time that  you can understand and comprehend. this method is very fast and efficient up until it hits 20:00 which is 8:00 pm. at that point you just need to know that 20:00 is 8:00 and through common sense determine that  23:00 is 11:00 pm because there's 24 hours in a day. at that point you just need the ability to subtract/add by a factor of 3 which most everyone can do on one hand (sorry to captain Hook and any other real or fictional amputees). also 12:00 am or midnight is just 0000 so nothing to worry about there."

Just imagine for a moment that Donald Trump and the GOP pay a british spy to develop a ""Poo-Poo"" Dossier on Joe Biden... and then use that as their evidence to secretly spy on anyone connected to Biden.

How would you react to that, do you think?

See - your position would be reasonable if there was something even close to evidence that started all the New Red Scare. But there wasn't a single bit of it.

Furthermore, imagine after using the FBI, CIA and NSA to spy on the Biden Campaign... Trump and the heads of the CIA, FBI and NSA all insist they didn't even know it was happening until they read about it in the Newspaper.

I said that human perception cannot be used to prove that reality exists, and therefore the only reason we could have to believe it exists is for some reason *other* than that we can perceive it. 

&gt;Stating that empirical evidence is not possible is a completely false statement.

Would you please refute my argument then? You give me no reason to believe you. As I said, the only way we can trust empirical evidence is by believing that physical reality exists, and the only reason we believe that is because we believe we trust the senses. It's totally circular, and therefore meaningless. It may be true that physical reality exists and that the senses are trustworthy, but my point is that the senses cannot be used as evidence for that claim.

&gt;The *nature* of reality can be debated, but its existence is not dependent upon you.

I never claimed it was. I also never claimed reality didn't exist, merely that it is entirely possible and equally probable that *physical reality* does not. Another way of stating it would be that reality could be totally non-physical."

2020-06-24 21:06:12,og_math_memes,"&gt;Empirical evidence IS observable evidence. That's the definition of it.

That was exactly my point. Clearly you didn't understand what I was saying. I was saying that any empirical/observable evidence is impossible, because it would not be evidence. It would be exactly the same as saying movies are real because you can observe them.

Think about it this way: why do you trust the senses? Because you believe there is a real physical world. Why do you believe there is a real physical world? Because you trust the senses. It's a totally meaningless fallacy that assumes what it's trying to prove in order to prove it.

Yes I know about Russell's Teapot, and that's exactly why the burden of proof is on *you*. You're the one postulating the existence of a massive chunk of reality just because of a set of experiences you have, which as I showed before you have absolutely no reason to trust.

&gt;1. You can't disprove it exists, regardless of your assertions.

I never tried to. I merely showed that you can't prove that it *does* exist, or give any reliable evidence for that claim.

In response to one of my possibilities you said, ""there is no logical or rational reason for this to be true,"" but there is also no logical or rational reason for it to be true that physical reality exists. So far the only reason you have given me is continuity. Physical reality continues to function the way it normally does whether it is observed or not. There are a few reasons this does not imply that physical reality actually exists.

1. It could be that your experiences are all that exist. You have a predetermined set of experiences, and nothing else exists. Not other people, not the physical world, not even *you*, except as your experiences. It's just as reasonable to believe that your experiences popped into existence in a consistent way as it is to believe that physical reality popped into existence in a consistent way. This is just as much a possibility as that reality exists because it is an alternative solution to the problem of consistency, the only logical problem you have raised so far.

2. There are other continuous sets of experiences we have that do not point to something real per se. One example is movies. A possibility is that reality is a preprogrammed ""movie"" that plays in your mind (this is basically the same as the first option). We have no reasom to believe this, and we have no reason not to believe this, just like your claim that reality exists.

3. There could be another being giving us these experiences. This is something like the ""we're living in a simulation"" proposition, except it does not include the existence of another physical reality that we are a simulated version of. Instead, it postulates that some being is giving us all these experiences in a consistent way. Since this being would not have the physical limitations we observe, we have no idea what such a being is capable of. As before, we have no reason to believe this, just as we have no reason to believe in physical reality.

Think about it this way: if you didn't have any senses, would you believe in physical reality?  Clearly not. In fact, you probably wouldn't even understand what that means. Thus your only reason for believing physical reality exists is because you have the senses. Your conclusion is based on experience, not reason. But as I said before, the only reason you believe that the senses point to something that actually exists is because you have already postulated its existence. You are the one inferring that experiences are a product of some external agent (physical reality) that actually exists. The only ""reason"" is that you have is the senses themselves, which could point to numerous other things, as I showed before. 

In the end you are choosing to blindly accept the senses with no reason to do so. For this reason, the burden of proof is most certainly on you."

&gt;‚ÄúSenator Byrd reflects the transformative power of this nation,‚Äù stated NAACP President and CEO Benjamin Todd Jealous. ‚ÄúSenator Byrd went from being an active member of the KKK to a being a stalwart supporter of the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act and many other pieces of seminal legislation that advanced the civil rights and liberties of our country.

&gt;‚ÄúSenator Byrd came to consistently support the NAACP civil rights agenda, doing well on the NAACP Annual Civil Rights Report Card. He stood with us on many issues of crucial importance to our members from the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, the historic health care legislation of 2010 and his support for the Hate Crimes Prevention legislation,‚Äù stated Hilary O. Shelton, Director of the NAACP Washington Bureau and Senior Vice President for Advocacy and Policy. ‚ÄúSenator Byrd was a master of the Senate Rules, and helped strategize passage of legislation that helped millions of Americans.

The Problem with your theory is we already have tens of thousands of active personnel in Europe and to be quite frank most of the military's over there have some trash equipment. 

Countries to be worried about:  
1) Germany: I mean obviously.  
2) France: Some of the heavy armor is pretty dang good, and the Mirage is a good plane. Take Paris though and history shows they give up pretty quick.  
3) Denmark/Norway/Sweden: Got some things to watch for over there, One thing in particular is their Self-Propelled Artillery.   
4) Almost everyone else uses an amalgamation of Russian/European/American cold war stuff. Easy targets.  
5) The U.K. depending on what side they choose would either be a somewhat challenging enemy or a nice jumping off point.

Obviously I cannot say with any certain fact that things would be that easy, but I do know that we would fight.

2020-06-24 15:49:52,Curiosidad_,"You did provide any evidence contrary to what I said. The reason I said trump was that that study was published in 2017. Also the trump administration has put a concerted and organized effort into making it seem like men, particularly white men are an oppressed group when they are clearly not. Men rarely get raped compared to women for two reasons. One is cultural. There is no culture that makes it seem okay for women to rape men. A video just came out of Joey Diaz bragging about raping women on Joe Rogan‚Äôs podcast from less than 10 years ago. Sadly that podcast has a very devoted and large fan base, which has uniformly defended that incident. You will never see an interview of some female comedian bragging about sexually men. 

Trump himself had bragged about it more than once. It‚Äôs unlikely someone like Hillary Clinton ever raped someone, and then bragged about it. There are a ton of recent studies regarding male sexual assault, and most of them never show men getting sexually assaulted even through coercion at a rate anywhere near the rate women endure. And certainly far below the rates in the article you cited. Your personal bias is clearly clouding how you feel about this pal. I have no personal bias. On this. I‚Äôm a white man. I have NEVER in my 4 years of college, my time in highschool, and after ever had a white male friend confess to me that they had been sexually assaulted. I have had literally dozens of women in that same span tell me they had been. Not to mention how many of those men I had heard describe things they did, which in retrospect I find problematic.

(The champions i've seen could even tell where you're from by looking at your clothes brands etc) of course it's not always obvious tho. 
  
So when you're traveling only from touristic place to touristic place people might only speak to you in English. When you go somewhere with mostly residents, people will speak to you in their language of course.

2020-06-24 15:04:21,EmperorRosa,"&gt;Yes, I said empirical evidence because observable evidence is impossible

Empiricak evidence IS observable evidence. That's the definition of it. 

&gt;Whether that experience corresponds to reality cannot be inferred from experience. 

It is reality. Whether it is simulated or not, it is our reality. 

&gt;One possibility is that there is some other being that is giving everyone a set of consistent experiences

There is no logical or rational reason for this to be true.

&gt;the self is merely a set of experiences

I mean, this is true regardless of whether you believe in reality. We are our actions and thoughts.

&gt;Postulating the existence of the physical world is just as much of a leap of faith as any of those possibilities

It absolutely is not. Our experience is empirical, our explanation of it is rational. 

&gt;The only way you could possibly show that the physical world exists is by referencing something outside it, as Descartes attempted to do.

This isn't true at all. You don't prove a football exists by proving the football field exists. 

&gt;Anyways, my point was that you can't prove the physical world exists. You may think it's a reasonable conclusion, but you can't have any evidence for that and in the end it's a pragmatic decision.

1. You can't disprove it exists, regardless of your assertions

2. Reality exists regardless of your perceptions, which proves that it is not imagined by one man. Animals react to stimuli regardless of observation, which proves it is not imagined by humanity as a whole. Physical collisions occur in space regardless of observation, which proves that it is not imagined by all forms of life.

Not to mention, the objective nature of physical laws generally show that reality is not imagined or constructed, since our experiences with these issues show that this level of objectivity from life, a creature, a human, doesn't exist. An entity stemming from life could not realistically account for all of these factors, because the experience of any given life is not so objective.

In addition, you do not have to disprove all alternate assertions given without evidence, to generally prove an assertion. You have the burden of proof in this example. People who assert reality do not have the burden of disproof. The most rational conclusion is that reality exists, until you gather enough evidence to suggest otherwise.

Research Russell's Teapot. ""He wrote that if he were to assert, without offering proof, that a teapot, too small to be seen by telescopes, orbits the Sun somewhere in space between the Earth and Mars, he could not expect anyone to believe him solely because his assertion could not be proven wrong.

It would be circular reasoning. The only thing experience shows us is that we are having an experience. Whether that experience corresponds to reality cannot be inferred from experience. 

Your option 2 is not what I'm proposing. I never said we invent the world as we detect it. There are numerous other possibilities that make much more sense. One possibility is that there is some other being that is giving everyone a set of consistent experiences (what Berkeley proposed). Another possibility is that the self is merely a set of experiences (this as stated by Hume requires no assumptions, and could be seen as the purely analytic conclusion). 

Postulating the existence of the physical world is just as much of a leap of faith as any of those possibilities (actually more of one than Hume's proposal). We have no evidence for it, and indeed it is impossible to have evidence for it, as Berkeley showed. The only way you could possibly show that the physical world exists is by referencing something outside it, as Descartes attempted to do.

Anyways, my point was that you can't *prove* the physical world exists. You may *think* it's a reasonable conclusion, but you can't have any evidence for that and in the end it's a pragmatic decision."

2. Reality is fake, and our senses are meticulously invented to literally invent a world as we detect it, including trillions of stars and worlds.

Not to mention, your specific use of the word ""empirical"". Empirical literally means ""observable"", therefore detectable by senses. Even if it was all fake/simulated, which is irrational and illogical, it would still be empirically real, because it is detectable."

Why is just presenting statistics so hard for you? This is like writing a paper but instead of listing primary sources, you just give another paper as your source and say it contains the actual sources to back up your claims.

So you idiots train your officers for way too long. What's your point? Correlation does not equal causation

I gave you a source and you are free to watch it. The first video was like 10 minutes long. You can be a social democrat and still support a militarized police force using violence to solve any problem coming their way.  But usually the right wingers do.

Sure we have less violence here due to socio economics and other factors but also the rates are so much lower due to the police being trained differently. In Sweden you do three years at the police academy and then six month of learning in the field with professional cops. Just for comparison. The Atlanta police have 50 hours of gun training in their education and only 8 hours on the rules of conduct. 

So if you are saying there are no problem with the American Police at all and it‚Äôs all fine then there is no use for me to spend my time here. But violence has always been the way for the Americans to solve any problems. We can only hope it will change soon."

However if it is genetic then wouldn‚Äôt that mean that all clones are gay, we know at least that clones aren‚Äôt asexual because of *that* deleted scene from the Bad Bunch episode (you know the one) - the problem with this is that the bad bunch are more like brothers / cousins to the rest of the clones rather than the same person.

‚ÄúOn average, the police fire at a person on just over 15 occasions a year.  This can be compared to the police making a total of 1.4 million interventions per year.

At an additional 15 times a year, the police fire warning shots. This means firing the weapon to warn that it will be used.‚Äù

This resulted in 4 people getting killed by the Swedish Police in 2014."

Here is a break down of the incident. The Atlanta police department state in their rule of conduct that for deadly force to be used a suspect have to be wielding a deadly weapon and to pose a serious threat of bodily harm or death to the police officer or others. A man running away with a piece of useless plastic is not. The tazer was discharged at 18 feet away and he had his back turned towards the police. There for not a deadly threat. They could pursue him, call for backup and try to de-escalate the situation again and put him under arrest correctly.

2020-06-24 09:34:28,angry_cabbie,"Alright, let's try this. 
 
Back in 2013 the FBI [expanded the definition of rape](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/violent-crime/rape), right? Including adding the concept of female perpetrators *kind of at all*. 
 
After that, there was a [general increase](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/national-international/fbi-report-shows-almost-20-percent-increase-in-rape-reports/1949679/) in reported rapes. Makes sense, with expanded definitions, yeah? 
 
Anyway, since then, there has (shockingly?) been a [massive uptick in males coming forward as victims](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2014.301946?journalCode=ajph&amp;), as well as data showing *women as perpetrators*. 
 
A [crapton of new data about perpetrators and victims](https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/04/male-rape-in-america-a-new-study-reveals-that-men-are-sexually-assaulted-almost-as-often-as-women.html) has come out because of this. *NEW DATA*. 
 
All this new data? Started coming out under Obama, not Trump (as you randomly threw out in a previous comment). 
 
And there's a reason the FBI changed their definition in 2013. It's [not a new idea](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3200/SOCP.146.3.275-291?casa_token=65dK0lg7aKsAAAAA%3A83Hsz_GzuJh-rgFQFr4S__rou3L52Ao214JfBgVtodF1-6H_luEV1kR833-3Gzw_XnjbC4gW5lpVaA&amp;) that male victims of female perpetrators are generally given the shaft, socially. 
 
Hells, [2008](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/j076v41n04_01), wasn't that when Obama was elected? Why the flying fuck did you even bring Trump into it in the first place? 
 
Fuck, in [2007](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1524838006296747?casa_token=nWLl9il2VEIAAAAA:YC8_l28EYBw94fGJpshdbgNCNzPRiiCdsVEQJQvEGKApMiO4CVa_IWm_uGoEPS1mFvqXKIZPvIqatw) information was coming out about people ignoring female perpetrators. 
 
Mix *all* of that shit in together with a continuing and expanding cultural understanding of what rape constitutes, as well as the, frankly, damn near ancient knowledge that men, in general, have been significantly less willing/likely to even come forward about being sexually victimized at all (as well as a few decades of cultural female empowerment), and it follows pretty damned easily that statistics have shown for a few years at this point that women rape or sexually assault men at roughly equal levels to men against women. 
 
So yeah, update your knowledge base. When did you finish college? More specifically, *how old are the studies you were previously referencing*? How out-of-date is your personal knowledge or understanding of the topic? Serious question. 
 
What all of this *should* do is make society realize that people are bastards, rape is not a gendered issue, and we should be working collectively to reduce victims regardless of sex or gender. The longer we pretend women are always victims, the longer the problem will keep manifesting. 
 
But no, let's just keep ignoring the data sets, ignoring the trends, and ignoring millions of victims and hundreds or thousands of rapists. No big deal there, right?"

2020-06-24 07:55:19,og_math_memes,"I never claimed the bible was historical fact, and I do not actually believe that for sizable portions of the bible. The ancient historian Josephus mentions Jesus as the Jewish messiah. The (thought to be anti-christian) Roman historian Tacitus mentions Jesus being put to death by Pontius Pilate, and Pliny the Younger also mentions him and how Christians saw him. Some scholars also believe that the Roman historian Suetonius referenced Jesus when he wrote that early Christians ‚Äúwere making constant disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus.‚Äù Please research whether your claims are supported by evidence before stating them as fact.

Second, with respect to copying, carpenters were extremely common in the first century, so that's isn't a rip-off. The virgin birth was a fulfillment of Jewish prophecies (for example Isaiah 7:14),  it a Christian rip-off. Dying and coming back to life was also present in Judaism. Furthermore, resurrection is a common trend in religions because of humans' extreme fear of death, so naturally it would make sense for a god to rise from the dead as a show of conquering fear.

Merely the fact that something commonly arises in multiple religions does not imply that it was copied. On the contrary the fact that it arises in multiple religions, some of which had no contact with each other (for example ancient Greek religion and Bhuddism) points to the fact that resurrection is a naturally revered idea. It makes it seem as if it is a universally understood mark of divinity."

There is speculation that he was resisting arrest because he was only out of jail due to COVID limitations, but he should still be serving for his charges of child abuse (which is also public).

I am not well versed on police protocol to say if anything was right or wrong, but the media is intentionally withholding crucial information about this particular case.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has not even finished investigating, but the DA has already made claims to the media so that is playing into the public perception as well."

She is a slave and her previous master left her broken, physically and mentally, to the point that she is given to you for free by a man you once saved, she would have been ""disposed of"" if you didnt agree to take her. The main point of the game is, as the name suggests, to restore her emotions. 

While the game is pornographic in nature and allows the player to do many bad things to her, the game actively punishes you for being a bad person, in fact, if you don't treat Sylvie well enough, she dies just a few days into the game. 

This pushes the player to not treat her as a target for sexual advances but rather as a daughter/little sister to take care of. Basically, Sylvie is best waifu because she is the best at bringing out the player's instinct to PROTECC"

Things may improve or not accept that you dont need to know to take precautions yourself. Large gatherings spread the virus, so stay away from protests, riots, or other large gatherings without taking precautions.

As citizens, we already know the inevitable: we cant go bankrupt and lose our houses over a tragedy that hasn't or may never occur. We are our own moral agents, and each of us are given the choice of how to proceed. We dont need a government to constantly update us because this virus is here to stay,  its existence in the population is now inevitable.

Everyone will get it. If you are safe, you may get the option of a vaccine instead. A vaccine may be a ways off though. .. till then, you need to pay for your existence via getting back to work any way you can. 

Trump didnt know what the virus would do. If he knew and said otherwise, then he would have lied. There is no evidence of that, only evidence of his poor choice of words as usual. He was right about the fatality rates though..  it is like the flu rate. 

Its not a big deal, if you cant keep your shit together and function through a pandemic, you got some bigger problems than a dislike for your president.

 Learn some respect, the man is doing his best."

2020-06-23 19:26:56,themetaorange,"I agree that there's no cookie cutter answer and exceptions will always prevent themselves.  In my state, i can walk into any sporting goods store or gun shop and get a pistol or rifle with just my ID and SSN.  After a three minute call to the state police I've got a new handgun.  In most cases people don't need that immediate access to firearms.

And once firearms are issued (or licenses are) i think it's important to at least have the owner have basic certification and education on safe handling of firearms.  Setting violent crime aside, the amount of poor judgment and inappropriate handling of firearms presents a serious danger as well.  

For instance, my step father who also owns firearms, has terrible trigger discipline and has flagged me on more than one occasion.  While i doubt he'd intentionally shoot me, I'm none to keen to be shot by accident either.

I believe that firearms make it harder for governments to oppress their citizens, I just want the citizens to be competent and fit to handle the firearms they own.  If that means additional licensing requirements,  I don't think that unduly infringes on one's right to carry."

Police are just thugs that are hired to take money from the poor and kidnap them for ransom. According to you they are also a death-squad justified by reciprocating logic.

Maybe if the officers had properly secured their weapons they wouldn't have to worry about a handcuffed man taking them from their pansy-esque lil paws."

I‚Äôm from Sweden and here the police are trained differently. So they acted accordingly. It‚Äôs extremely rare here that a police even draw his/hers gun and if he/she do they have to file a report stating the situation and why they did so. After that the situation is evaluated. If the force was necessary nothing happens and if not they are prosecuted accordingly. Recently we had a situation where a cop shot a man with Down‚Äôs syndrome who were playing with a toy gun and that sparked a shit storm. Now there are plans to educate the police more on people with disabilities and mental illnesses. 

As a swede the American police system i broken. Not even alone, you have more of them in your own country. Change is coming and you will be on the wrong side of history."

2020-06-23 17:14:28,TheCheerfulCynic,"""Little brawl"" he assaulted to officers and stole fucking weapons.

You have proof for this ""chocked and fearing for his life"" emotional appeal of yours. He started the fight! You don get to play the sympathy card when he randomly attacked them.

They did tase him but he kept fighting. They shot him when he turned to shoot them with the taser he stole, which both qualifies as a deadly weapon and if he did stun a cop could give him an opening to steal their gun next.

The officers tried tackling him, raising him, and warning him to stop REPEATEDLY. He ignored them.

Cops arent supposed to aim for the leg. They are trained to hit the center of mass because it's the largest target. Also a leg shot is still often time lethal because a major artery runs through it. Those police who you claim shot him in the leg are the ones ego fuvked up for not following procedure and aiming for center of mass."

 I can understand if this guy was running around with a knife trying to stab random people and after being tazed and pepper sprayed still going after the cops with the intent of killing them. Then I can understand the use of deadly force. But in this incident in see no justifying to shot a man several times in the back. Period.

I‚Äôve seen police shoot a man and there was justification for that in that moment and still the police shot him in the leg. The guy had a fight in a bar and pulled a knife, went out on the street and got confronted by the police. The police mazed him, shot two warning shots and verbally telling him to drop the knife and get on the ground. Finally they put a bullet in his leg and then put him under arrest. Guy survived, no cop harmed."

I remember when /r/politics was removed from the front page, and have since seen Reddit become more of an entertainment website. I am happy with the entertainment, though Reddit is also an important place for political discussions, if one now can manage to find the sub where this happens.

Regardless of that, in your justice system police officers have no authority to judge someone's guilt, that's for the courts. And even if police could decide judicial cases on the spot, is instant death really a fitting punishment?

Ask yourself this. As a black man in a country that's quickly becoming known for the police killing black men - would you have ran for your life? Would you have taken steps to defend your life?

Cos honestly, you're a fucking complete bitch if you wouldn't. If you were drunk driving, and the police pulled you over, scared you to the point where you do something irrational, and then shot you dead- would that be cool? Would your parents just be like ""oh well he should have just let the police harass him and stayed calm""? Would you be fine with that cop being back on duty after taking your life with no court case?

You're focusing on what he had done, and completely ignoring the fact those coppers murdered the poor man. That is a very very telling sentiment on your part."
2020-06-23 14:47:04,MegaM3tin,"Innocent until the difference is proven in court. The base in any modern justice system. Cops have no right in killing people. Police are only allowed to use deadly force as a last resort when their own life is in direct danger. Someone running away with a discharged tazer is in no way a threat to two armed and trained police officers. Risking getting bruised or some scratches is not a reason to kill a person.

Your argument is some crazy Phillipino Duterte shit. He told the police to execute people in the streets if they suspect they are drug dealers....."

It's a long read and in case reading is not your thing, it's paragraph 10. However, I would recommend reading the rest of the article so you can really learn how stupid you sound defending them.

Also it has already been said multiple times the officers lives were not in danger. He had a taser that was no longer usable and was running with his back to them. How fragile do you have to be to feel in danger and kill someone? And to the community? What are you even talking about here?? Let's talk about that. The officers fired another shot that hit a car with three passengers in it that had NOTHING to do with it. The only danger to the community in this instance were the police."

Very far from the largest TV network audience for a political event.  Not even close actually.  To compare, 84 Million people tuned in to watch Trump's impeachment trial.  

Explain to me why you think you can tell such an obvious lie.  Do you think you can get away with it?  Is it that you don't know any better and repeat any damn fool thing you hear on Fox News?  It can't possibly make you feel good about yourself to wallow in such deep ignorance, can it?

2020-06-23 14:05:47,CaielG,"I don't know anyone who would agree that a man deserved to be killed for that, regardless of skin color. Assault and resisting arrest is NOT punishable by death. They shot a man in the back while he was running away with a taser already discharged twice (so it was no longer usable).
Not to mention, he was handcuffed before being told why he was being arrested, which is against policy, so it's not shocking there was resisting. The officer had a ""minor injury"" and a man lost his life and you think that it's only being made in to a big deal because he's black? FOH, you are part of the problem."

Floyd's not the most egregious death at the hands of the police, but he's 'sympathetic' enough with certain cuts of a civilian camera that his story can be sold and packaged to feed into the ""blacks are being discriminated against"" narrative that the likes of the Zimmerman story set up.

Now following that, they can continue to 'report' on 'similar stories' such as the guy who got shot while trying to steal a cop's weapons, a story that would otherwise be insignificant if not for the racial frenzy they've whipped the public into.

Their undying support means that they can make a story out of practically anything, and people who follow their outrage will lap it up."

Try not to think about how your tongue can't find a good resting position.

Try not to breathe manually.

Try not to think about kicking a needle in between your toenail. 

Try not to think about urethral insertion.

Try not to think about how you can see your nose.

Try not to think about ""Somebody once told met the world was gonna roll me. I ain't the sharpest tool in the sheee\~ed."" looping over and over again.

And here is the BIG one: Try to keep your Trump derangement syndrome to yourself. This board is for anime tits.

Most women I‚Äôve known since college have had some kind of sexual assault. And I would say at least 1 in 4-5 has been raped in some capacity almost every girl I‚Äôve ever dated has told me about an ex they had who had raped them after they clearly said no (typically as recurring act). 

No you aren‚Äôt necessarily sheltered but most women aren‚Äôt exactly screaming from the rooftops about arguably the worst moments in their lives."

So other than pulling weeds I continue to water and they keep growing. The cost of entry is really low if you have a patch of dirt and water. It's a fun rewarding hobby and I recommend trying if you can.

2020-06-22 23:10:41,ME24601,"&gt; You can't refute a single thing this little girl claims, can you? Give it a try if you dare.

We've been over this [the last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/hb5j88/redpill_after_redpill/) you pretended this was a good argument.

&gt;You've never given a shit about what is factually accurate, so debunking her claims for you is an exercise in futility. If the video was arguing that the world was flat and the moon is a myth because those claims were to somehow serve to defend Donald Trump's actions, you would believe it unquestionably, as there is nothing that can convince you that Trump would ever do or say anything wrong, and pointing out how absurd that would be would only be held as ""proof"" that you're right.

&gt;For the benefit of anyone else, I'll humor you. To go with the two I watched, both deliberately ignore context in order to create a false equivalency. Building a wall on the Southern border is not the same thing as creating an autonomous zone in Seattle, and pressuring the Ukrainian government to fire a judge because multiple different countries found him to be corrupt is not the same as pressuring the Ukrainian government to investigate a political opponent to help one's campaign."
