If they want to live alone away from everyone that‚Äôs fine. They want to speak out about how people should believe what they do, they get whatever consequences that entails. Their lives do not matter to me. And seeing you bend over backwards to try and create an argument that isn‚Äôt there is both amusing and concerning. 

And let me cut you off at the pass of your next argument. I am not going to say people aren‚Äôt allowed to be nazis, that‚Äôs a choice and a pivotal one for my opinion.

2020-07-22 14:53:08,asmodraxus,"So what you are saying is that person from ethnic group A, life matters more then person of ethnic grouping B according to your opinion?   Therefore if person of ethnic group B infringes on the personal, economic of social well being of ethnic group A there needs to be some form of recompense?  That is a slippery slope leading to the concentration camp if you take it to the next logical conclusion, and again and again... Kind of like what happened in the last century in Germany, or Rwanda, or Cambodia, what was Yugoslavia, North America, South America or anywhere else genocide has occurred.  In 10 easy steps you too can have a genocidal regime.

Once you have defined ethnic group B as other, they not really human are they, so does it really matter if you proceed to exterminate them, its not as if they feel pain, its actually a mercy if you think about it...

Shame if you happen to be in the wrong ethnic group then your opinion doesn't matter (hint of coarse it does) and the above is as abhorrent today as it always was.

Pedophilia is another matter based around human rights and the differing levels of power between people, age is a number but its what goes with the number, physical and mental maturity therefore what a pedophile says is based on a incomplete understanding of biology.  But that's a completely different argument, by arguing this you are saying that oranges are the same fruit as apples as they are both round and edible.

What I'm saying is that no matter how reprehensible the person, they may have some qualities that redeem them, even if its only to study and figure out whether there is some mental illness that causes them to be that way or what socio economic conditions cause such a abhorrent philosophy and what can be done to mitigate and or stop it in the future.

You might believe that all Nazis are evil and should be killed, but that takes puts you in the same boat to some extent as the people you profess to hate as you are playing judge, jury and executioner if you act on that belief."

Next, let‚Äôs address all nazis being evil. No, not all nazis were evil. Hell, a few tried to kill hitler. Good for them. Luckily, I‚Äôm not proposing we go back in time to punch some nazis, I‚Äôm talking about modern times where people, fully aware of what the nazis did and not forced by any measure to follow them, choose to call themselves nazis and uphold their racist and genocidal beliefs.

Lastly, nazi refers to more than just the political party. The term has since changed and you‚Äôre stupid if you think terms and words don‚Äôt do that."

2020-07-22 10:16:13,Author1alIntent,"Every life matters. Nobody is too far along a path to change. Nazis are bad people, but we can and should try to steer them away from hatred. Hate stems from ignorance and isolation, which education and cooperation helps to eliminate. Consider for a moment Daryl Davis, the black man who attends KKK rallies to make Klansmen consider leaving the Klan. I think he has succeeded in making something like 200 leave, one of whom was the High Wizard. If that is possible, anything is possible.

I would wager a good portion of Neo-Nazis are also incels, and in general young men shunned from society, looking for a scapegoat for their problems. 

If we take The Left‚Äôs advice and ‚ÄúPunch all Nazis‚Äù all we succeed in doing is fostering more hatred and animosity, driving further divisions when we should be coming together. Violence will not persuade people to listen to you. Punching people for dissenting opinions is wrong. ‚ÄúCut our a man‚Äôs tongue and you don‚Äôt prove him a liar, just that you‚Äôre afraid what he has to say.‚Äù

We are right. Nazism is a flawed ideology because POC, Jews, LGBT people etc. Are human beings just like any other. If we can‚Äôt convince people of the truth, where does that leave us?

It also doesn‚Äôt help that Woke people can‚Äôt decide who is an isnt a Nazi. Is it actual Nazis? Trump supporters? Right wing people? People who don‚Äôt follow their specific brand of politics? Without that definition, ‚ÄúPunch a Nazi‚Äù now becomes ‚Äúpunch anyone you disagree with‚Äù which inevitably leads to the strongest, most violent political group in power. 

I‚Äôm not defending Nazism. I‚Äôm not saying we can save every Nazi. I‚Äôm not saying we should stand by and let Nazism grow. 

All I am saying is, Nazis are people too, and they deserve a chance to better themselves. If they don‚Äôt take it, that is their decision, but we can console ourselves with knowing we *tried*."

They openly use n-words and are openly pro nazi and hitler, often in the garb of ‚Äújokes‚Äù

I've also heard this talking point. It's what the people defending nazis often say  to try to make anti-fascist direct action look bad.

I believe it's fair to characterize Spencer as a nazi though - even though this isn't Germany in 1939.

And let's be honest here, politics in the US is showing a lot of [fascist characteristics and tendencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_fascism) these days. So if we conflate ""nazi"" with ""fascist"", you could say there is a decent population of people that could carry that label in the US, especially at far-right rallies. It's not like they don't exist.

That being said, I think there is a distinction between someone who defends a nazi (but actually doesn't support fascist ideas) and an actual nazi (defending another nazi or not). The former being typically called a [""useful idiot""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot) while the latter is better characterized as just ""a nazi"". I think we can all agree that idiots shouldn't be punched just for being idiots."

This snowballed and now the only news you‚Äôll hear about us bad news. Natural, when the 2000‚Äôs rolled around everyone who knew what furries were they probably had a negative opinion on them.

140,000 dead

Trump spread misinformation and was not active enough in his response

Republicans will blame it on China.

1. 140,000 dead is a statistic, just pure fact (144k btw)

2. Trump has spread misinformation about his miracle cures, injecting people with disinfectant, and about how quickly the virus will disappear.  Blatantly ignoring faucis recommendations is also misinformation as some people will take the word of the president as fact.

3. Blame it on China.  I guess this is politically biased so you get 1/3d points.  From my experience most people will just blame this problem on China and pretend the US isn‚Äôt doing just as bad.  Do I believe that China is faultless?  Absolutely not, they had the chance to nip this before it became a real issue, or atleast warn the world about it.  But trump allowed the US to become a breeding ground for the disease spreading it worldwide."

I'm going to admit to not having read the communist manifesto, which probably isn't a good idea. I've studied Marx in second hand mainly, though I was under the impression, at least from arguing with Marxist that the totalitarian regimes that always arise when attempting to implement his theories are supposed to fall away and leave a classless workers paradise in their wake.

I've always founds Marx's view of historical materialism to be, while sometimes useful, much too simplistic, and to be frank boring, hence why I didn't pick up many courses focusing on him.

I could not disagree with you harder on the individuals worth under communism, though I am finding it hard to put into words - English is not my first language. Communism in it's very name implies a focus on community on groups (or more specifically classes) when you apply that the importance of the individual is lost. Which I consider to be one of the fatal flaws of communism, the indivudual is less important than the group,  which gives license to trample on indivudual rights - this I think neatly fits in with the reality of human rights in communist countries.

I was more jabbing at wasting an upper-level credit on a rather pointless course purely for self fulfillment. My degree is in Political Science though, I'm just focused on the law side. 

You're correct. In that the fascist theory is good for state is paramount to the individual. Your interpretation for why Hitler wanted to preserve the Aryans could be argued that the expunging of undesirables were for the sake of the state at individual expense. That nazi Utopia also happened to be an aryan ethnostate. He really needed a scapegoat for the average German to pin why the hell a loaf of bread was a billion deutschmarks and the ethnicity that was historically forced into banking made the ideal choice. 

We can split hairs trying to piece together exactly what kind of regime NAZI Germany actually was. But for all intents and purposes it fits the bill of fascism more neatly than socialism. 

I don't understand you equating communism as being a stateless regime. Anarcho communism is an extremely niche political dogma that most people (correctly) point out as being contradictory. I imagine you being historically and politically educated have read the Communist Manifesto. The book portrays transitioning communism as an exceedingly slow but catalyzed by a few major societal upheavals. 

Sparing the details I think his interpretation of communism was the antithesis of your definition of fascism. Where what is good for the individual is good for the government. Fascism is a regime in which a government inflicts its will on the people. Communism is the individual inflicting its will on the government. Oftentimes this necessitates a lot of government, but that government doesn't necessarily need to restrict social freedoms to be economically strong."

Disagree on that hitlers germany was fascist - it was indeed a totalitarian government, but I always figured fascism is a very specific brand of totalitarianism where the indivudual considered a cell of the state and for example if something is good for the state but bad for the individual then it is still good, while hitlers germany was very concerned about the future of the white race.

Also, Nazis were definitely fascists (I know socialist is in the name). It was to appeal to the laborers who were suffering after the economic collapse in the 20s. Calling your movement socialist tended to resonate with blue collars. 

Mussolini literally invented fascism by likening the government and people to a bundle of twigs: strong when tightly bound together. Given that this nominally first fascist regime was extremely similar to Hitler's we can safely say it was also fascist instead of the academic definition of socialism.

I'm not doing the standard ""people abuse it"" argument for communism, I'm saying that the ideology is so fundamentally flawed that while it doesn't outright call for genocide or other violence that or something of similar severity will always be the case when you attempt to put it into practice. 

And it's because of that that communisms kill count is so astronomical, to the point where you're right it would be unfair to put it and nazism in the same cathegory because nazisms kill count is significantly lower and is nowadays relegated to fringe groups, while communist countries and parties still operate openly."

What I mean is that there are millions of people like you, republicans in a blue state, that choose not to vote. Because of that - people like Hillary get to claim she should be president because she got more votes than Trump.

Now - I get it. I'm in CA. About 80% of votes in my district were cast for Clinton. It was a blowout. But every little drop really does count.

I actually voted for Johnson and Weld last time. Felt good to vote for another party for the first time. But really - I was voting for 2 Republicans.

Anyway - I ask you to think on those 3 points. I will be voting for Trump in 2020, no doubt. Even though there is literally no way he can win here.

Ironically, Democrats will continue to vote Democrat - even though they spent the last month in the streets protesting and rioting over the police policies that have been run by Democrats for the last 30 years. Democrats will continue to vote Democrat - even though the Democrats are the ones shutting down their businesses and locking them in their homes.

I do and did that because I enjoy the memes, porn, and all manner of funny shitpost that have largely taken over the sub for now and it's nice not to have to think about politics sometimes. Also some of the people that post politics here might actually want to have someone engage with their post and it seems to me they'll have better luck with that on r/animetitties or any of the other myriad politics/news subs. Not that that is my original intention of course, I really just like this being a random chaotic sub about whatever people wanna post.

1) You add to the ""Hillary actually won the popular vote"" crowd if you don't vote.

2) States will only change if all the people in it like you go out and vote.

3) somewhere between 60-65 million voters actually vote for the President that wins. They are usually within just a few million of each other. Of those that vote, there are really only a few million that swing between parties. If 94 million don't vote at all, then it really only takes a small percentage of that 94 million to change the outcomes."

Instead you need to know about political theory in general in order to persuade the swing voters that you actually understand politics; you need to have an air of self-confidence (not arrogance though) in your knowledge, not just screaming ‚ÄúTRUMP IS A RACIST!!!‚Äù whether or not it‚Äôs true doesn‚Äôt matter because no one will take you seriously anyways. So go ahead and read some political theory, it doesn‚Äôt matter what ideology it‚Äôs conveying just read something, it won‚Äôt take too long (the communist manifesto is only 34 pages for instance) and a lot of it you can get for free. Honestly I doubt you will, but please prove me wrong and stick it to me by reading something by at least one of the following: Bordiga, Stirner, Miller, Marx, Mussolini (fascism is a dumpster fire but you can still learn things from it), Rand, Lenin, etcetera.

You are denying the existence of literal direct quotes from interviews that anyone can access.

You're complaining that I didn't link to videos and then when I explain that I literally did link to them, you complain that compilations are just too complicated for you like that's MY issue - because you are completely incapable of addressing the point.

2020-07-21 18:05:24,JerryC63,"&gt;Why is it so hard for you to link the videos youre referring to

An article with a compilation is supposed to make it easier for the mentally disabled like you. Somehow you made it more complicated.

That's the thing. You aren't looking to have your mind changed. Trolls like you never are. You just look to waste someone's time. Demand proof for the undeniable, and when it's provided, spend hours distracting.

Notice how, even now, you refuse to address the example? I told you exactly where to look. Yet another example of him struggling with fractions. Your ""it was just a one time typo!"" talking point is gone. So what do you do? Distract. Again. You can't address reality. 

Undeniable examples of him struggling to spell, struggling to understand basic fractions, him saying exactly what you asked for proof of him saying, and not once have you addressed them.

&gt;If you cannot link me the specific videos and clips youre constantly bringing up I wont be replying to you any further

Address. The. Chris. Wallace. Interview.

&gt;Your derogatory and frankly unhinged rants are giving me a headache.

You really need help. I'm serious. I told you exactly what Trump said exactly where he said it. There are countless articles about him saying it. Pick any one you want - it doesn't matter. Trump said it in the Chris Wallace interview. Go watch the interview if you don't believe me. I already cited it.

You are legitimately deranged."

The police in America (again, only example I have found) have some kind of complex where they think that they're above the law and can get away with this shit and play judge, jury and executioner.

Are you denying the other examples exist? You think Donald Trump doesn't struggle with spelling on twitter or his multiple hand written horrific spelling errors?

&gt;The article you linked has the Trump typo tweet and followed by a bunch of twitter screenshots mocking it. Where is the proof?

You are clearly disabled. Look at the last tweet.

It isn't enough for me to provide examples of Trump's own literal words - I need to hold your hand even further and point to the extremely specific parts of articles.

It is a ***video.*** Of him ***verbally saying*** ""1000/24th"".

&gt;You cited jack shit! You told me to google it to which I replied with the fact that google is biased so its pointless trying to find anything relating to Trump that is unbiased.

You seriously need help. I mean it. You really need help. Will caps help your comprehension? I don't know how to cater to someone as clearly disabled as you.

**IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE THE CHRIS WALLACE INTERVIEW IS CITED. THE VIDEO IS THE VIDEO.** He clearly says to Chris Wallace, himself, verbally, being recorded in the interview that the cognitive test was ""very hard"".

That is not open to ""bias"". It happened. It's recorded. You asked. That's the answer. Address it.

&gt;Again, on what basis?

Your complete inability to comprehend the most basic of facts. It doesn't matter if the Chris Wallace video is in a brietbart article or a Motherjones article - IT'S THE SAME VIDEO.

&gt;You keep making these statements but not once have you conherently backed it up.

You asked for an example of Trump saying the cognitive test was hard and I provided an example ***of him literally word for word saying the test was very hard in an interview.***

Address it."

Yeah how about we be really clear here. I asked for proof of Trump having special needs. You provided me with one article about a tweet! That is not proof of anything, that's one occasion. I asked you multiple times to show me this proof that youve clearly seen because you support the claim, but you keep throwing fits and name calling me. 

&gt;When asking for proof he struggles with fractions, you think he made some really impossible typo and you're also denying the very clear existence of other examples in one article i cited. 

The article you linked has the Trump typo tweet and followed by a bunch of twitter screenshots mocking it. Where is the proof? 

&gt;You asked for proof Trump said the cognitive test was hard and when I cited an example that is less than 7 days old and was in the news everywhere, you went on a nonsense ""google is bad"" rant instead of addressing it.

You cited jack shit! You told me to google it to which I replied with the fact that google is biased so its pointless trying to find anything relating to Trump that is unbiased.

Are you illiterate? They go on to mention how Trump struggled multiple times with Warren and her ""1000/24th"" heritage. 

&gt;Do you even know what pearl clutching means?

You're acting offended over insults. I have every right to insult you when you are using such an idiotic tactic.

&gt;On what basis?

You seem pretty clearly on the spectrum.

Let's be really clear. When asking for proof Trump struggles to spell, you ignored the proof. When asking for proof he struggles with fractions, you think he made some really impossible typo and you're also denying the very clear existence of other examples in one article i cited. You asked for proof Trump said the cognitive test was hard and when I cited an example that is less than 7 days old and was in the news everywhere, you went on a nonsense ""google is bad"" rant instead of addressing it.

There is something wrong with you."

2020-07-21 13:30:55,jormundr,"Finally!
Then let‚Äôs talk about the issue at hand and why them doing this is wrong. 
What you and the other guy failed to mention is that the department of homeland security is the one behind the arrests (This is important to note in a moment). They have sent ICE, coast guard, TSA, and border patrol agents to assist in the ‚Äúprotecting of federal property‚Äù and, of note, are the ones largely behind the arrests while wearing no identifying markings. As you have stated, correctly, this by itself is perfectly legal (though I‚Äôd still like to add it‚Äôs concerning in the high number it is being deployed) especially as the homelands security office is citing 40 US code 1315, which allows for deputizing people to protect federal property, arrest people without a warrant, and conduct investigations ‚Äúon and off the property in question‚Äù. 

However, at this time they are doing so against the consent of the local officials of Portland and the charges they are coming up with for the arrests are stretching at best to validate the use of officers. The number of arrests being made like this is additionally alarming and is the reason the entire thing is being brought into question because it shouldn‚Äôt be used as an intimidation tactic to suppress protests. 

I don‚Äôt know why people seem to think that being against this means I‚Äôm against people being arrested for crimes, I‚Äôm perfectly fine with it that‚Äôs the rule of law and I want it applied to those in power as well because that‚Äôs how it works. I‚Äôm against abuses of power and this is pretty blatantly one of those cases."

2020-07-21 13:25:29,ThatRandomWhiteBoy,"A lot of states like NY used to also have a lot more cases, they were the hotspots so of course their deaths will be higher: lots more cases and likely much more overrun hospitals and such.

2020-07-21 07:35:24,gtgg9,"What I‚Äôm about to post isn‚Äôt intended to upset you, merely to inform. Simply put, it isn‚Äôt illegal to utilize covert operations to detain or arrest someone suspected of a crime. The crime isn‚Äôt required to be a felony either. As a matter of fact, there‚Äôs a large number of federal misdemeanor crimes, which are usually adjudicated before a federal magistrate. They carry a potential sentence of 12 months or less, so they don‚Äôt qualify as felonies.

Any federal law enforcement officer may detain/arrest a subject based on reasonable articulable suspicion/probable cause respectively, for a misdemeanor federal crime committed in their presence. In the case of Portland, the likelihood is that these operations were carried out by the Federal Protective Service and ICE-HSI. 

How it probably worked is a UC observer witnesses and documents the crime, while notifying the ‚Äúcatch team‚Äù of who to grab once they‚Äôre separated from the crowd so as to avoid being the catalyst for a riot (I‚Äôm specifically using the word catalyst because ‚Äúincitement‚Äù is a crime and cannot arise from performing a lawful government function).

The agents performing such an operation will still be required to conduct their ops within agency policy, and present their documented case to the US Attorney‚Äôs office with jurisdiction. 

As to your concerns, most of what you believe was unlawful, simply isn‚Äôt. The detained person or persons will still retain all their legal and civil rights. They will still be entitled to legal representation and redress of any grievances they may have over the mechanics of the detention or arrest.

You and/or the media wouldn‚Äôt have any legal standing beyond a FOIA request. That request would most likely identify the agencies involved and possibly what division or units were involved, but the individual names of agents would probably be redacted, due to undercover identification concerns. That doesn‚Äôt mean those names wouldn‚Äôt be available to the accused or their counsel, they‚Äôd likely just be sealed by the court. The accused would still be allowed to face their accuser(s) in court.

I recognize this is a sensitive issue politically, but so much of what‚Äôs being said on both sides is erroneous or false. The Supremacy Clause is fully operative in this case, which means the city and state have no standing to demand the U.S. government cease these operations. There‚Äôs still federal property to protect, as well as American citizens who retain their legal and civil rights regardless of the decision by local and state authorities to selectively enforce the law based on political considerations.

It‚Äôs indisputable that within these ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù and ‚Äúlawful‚Äù protests, crimes against both property and persons are being committed. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with identifying the perpetrators of said crimes and detaining them, openly or covertly. It‚Äôs entirely possible for a protester to lawfully protest, commit a crime, then resume lawful protesting. Does that make them a ‚Äúpeaceful protester‚Äù arrested for exercising their rights? No. Law enforcement didn‚Äôt arrest the peaceful protester, they arrested the person who committed a crime. That‚Äôs called nuance, and it seems conspicuously missing from your idea of what‚Äôs happening. 

Hopefully this will inform, so you can move to a position where you can discern the difference between police brutality and lawful enforcement of the law."

2020-07-21 07:07:21,futureshock999,"Providing healthcare coverage for 30 million people - which Obamacare does - is the second best solution.  Single payer is better, and potentially cheaper, but I understand that vested interests won‚Äôt let that happen - not immediately at least.  So I love the effects of Obamacare, which is to provide health insurance for those that could not get coverage at all in the past.

Romney implemented the same system in Massachusetts, as a REPUBLICAN effort.   At the time, many Massachusetts Democrats were against it, because they said it was ‚Äútoo limited‚Äù.  Now people are against it (‚ÄúObamacare‚Äù) saying it does too much.

Revisionist history -- it never ""became"" anything. It was purposely created as a political sub with a juvenile name, expecting that adults would eagerly want to seriously discuss world geo-politics in a sub-reddit with a semi-NSFW name named after Japanese-style cartoon breasts.

There exists many other ""world politics"" sub-reddits without such sophomoric and juvenile ""in crowd"" names."

You realize that Red states take more money from Fed Govt than blue states?- a lot more.  https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/ap-fact-check-blue-high-tax-states-fund-red-low-tax-states
You know Trump and his father (Who was arrested at a KKK rally) were legally forced to rent to Black people? The Republican narrative (in practice not theory) has been to keep black people out of the suburbs, uneducated, and at low paying jobs for the last half century.  They incarcerated a generation of black men for mostly drug offenses that many white men could have also been found guilty of.  My wife has been a teacher for 17 years split between schools servicing wealthy white areas and the projects with mostly students of color. You have some junk politicians everywhere and there are good meaning ones in the cracks  but you are looking at a 90% white male GOP Congress right now who complain about the system they did everything they could to break so they could use it as a cheap talking point. They are not interested in fixing the system.
 You do realize political parties have changed significantly with the advent of the ""Southern Strategy?""  If that is a new term for you, then I mean this constructively, you've got more to learn.
Here is Lee Atwater, one of Ronald Reagan's top advisors on tape explaining it.  Doesn't get much clearer and now Trump is just saying the quiet parts out loud.  Speaking of Reagan and the term ""Welfare Queen""- he made it up from one story he heard.  

https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/12/20/255819681/the-truth-behind-the-lies-of-the-original-welfare-queen

I could walk you back to 1865 and reconstruction and take you right up to now and you'd be hard pressed to find a time when the Black community hasn't had the thumb held down on them. We had a segregated army in WWII- guess who didn't get to participate in the GI bill that educated and bought houses for a generation of working class white men?  https://www.history.com/news/gi-bill-black-wwii-veterans-benefits


On an a personal anecdotal level, I grew up in a wealthy white family that lived in GA and CT.  Our Black nanny was asked to leave our neighborhood pool and our house was threatened to be burned down in GA- 1980s.  In the early 2000s my parents sold real estate in CT- they got death threats for showing Black families homes. I've learned a lot because there was a point in my life I thought like you did.  I believe you need accountability from everyone in every neighborhood but you can't with a straight face tell me a party led by Trump is not just outright based on white supremacy and racism.  
The guy was tweeting his supporters yelling ""White Power!"" and praising them- not even a dog whistle anymore."

(I also wanna add that she's worked for other porn companies before getting with bangbros,but she doesn't talk about them). If bangbros is lying,she could easily disprove their claim. Also, i never said that hiring an army is the only way to help somebody. That wasn't even a serious comment lol

&gt;Pornhub leaves up rape and revenge porn even after being notified that it was nonconsensual. They have the ability to remove videos, but choose not to remove those.

That literally has nothing to do with Mia. We're not talking about rape or revenge porn.


&gt;Stop whiteknighting for shitty companies.

stop whiteknighting for people who have a history of contradicting themselves. Just because there are companies that do bad things doesn't mean that mia is being honest with us. I would love to take to you some more,but you've already demonstrated that you're not really interested in looking at sources that  criticize mia"

&gt;‚ÄúSenator Byrd reflects the transformative power of this nation,‚Äù stated NAACP President and CEO Benjamin Todd Jealous. ‚ÄúSenator Byrd went from being an active member of the KKK to a being a stalwart supporter of the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act and many other pieces of seminal legislation that advanced the civil rights and liberties of our country.

&gt;‚ÄúSenator Byrd came to consistently support the NAACP civil rights agenda, doing well on the NAACP Annual Civil Rights Report Card. He stood with us on many issues of crucial importance to our members from the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, the historic health care legislation of 2010 and his support for the Hate Crimes Prevention legislation,‚Äù stated Hilary O. Shelton, Director of the NAACP Washington Bureau and Senior Vice President for Advocacy and Policy. ‚ÄúSenator Byrd was a master of the Senate Rules, and helped strategize passage of legislation that helped millions of Americans. He will be sorely missed.‚Äù - [The Hill](https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/106189-naacp-mourns-byrds-death)"

It's pretty high in THC, a surprising amount of CBD and the Blueberry strain contributes other cannabinoids that gives the weed an energizing buzz despite a good amount of CBD.

You won't find it in any of the weed dispensaries since our ""legal"" weed stores are more interested in profit than in providing a specific medical attributes (e.g. the energy concept). And when it comes to subtle things like the smell when growing plants, the smell when smoked, the harshness of the smoke or the taste, such things do not factor into their business models. As capitalist businesses they're interested in profit for their rich shareholders first and foremost.

But because their vehicles dont have enough logos for OP, and because the mainstream media is also fellating the rioters for ratings, the narrative is being spun that these are secret police arresting innocent people."

Mayor, governor, district attorneys, and others told him to remove them. Federal agents then also begin arresting people off the street in unmarked vans near the protests and riots. Most of these arrests result in misdemeanors, which begs the question of why are federal agents arresting people off the street in unmarked vans to only charge for misdemeanor offenses?

2020-07-20 23:33:55,HalEmpyrion,"So, about this. This flag is and historically has been used to protest government overreach. Originally used during the American Revolution it is to show that the people were fed up with the British iron fist. Now it is used by people of my mindset, anti authoritarian right/center, the belief that the federal government should provide a military and prevent the states from acting like toddlers or elderly people who just scream about those millenials. That flag is completely opposite of letting the government get away with stuff like blackbagging, and I at least agree that any form of that activity occurring within the United States must be stopped. However arresting and levying vandalism charges against those who deface public property is not a bad thing as some amount of our tax dollars goes to repairing the property damaged. That tax money should most certainly go to telling these folks what history is.

All in all, good message, wrong flag/politcal ideology."

2020-07-20 20:34:22,IntnsRed,"&gt;  with the fact that you made a false assumption

You know not of what you speak. There is no false assumption.

I've had discussions and debates with the moderators of r/animetitties about the name. They purposely created that nonsensical name which I think is sophomorish and stupid.

I've also talked with other redditors who are interested in world politics who refuse to use that sub because of the insulting name. Other redditors say they cannot use that sub because the name is NSFW-ish and they're using reddit from work.

My guess -- only a conspiracy-minded guess which the r/animetitties moderators say is not their plan -- is that the r/animetitties will eventually make a play and appeal to reddit corporate to take over this r/worldpolitics sub. That's what the moderators of r/world_politics did -- took it over.

As someone who has used reddit for well over a decade, I've watched these drama-laden soap opera moves be done again and again in different subs.

To me, the r/animetitties not only has the insulting name, but the moderators have too many rules -- many more than r/WorldPoliticsMinusUS.

I favor the moderation angles of r/worldpolitics2 which is to moderate as little as possible, increasing moderation with the consent of the sub only if/when problems arise.

The tactics of r/animetitties users and/or moderators seem suspicious to me.

I frequently cross-post posts from r/worldpolitics2 and get single downvotes with comments like yours urging myself and people to use r/animetitties -- the sub named for Japanese-style cartoon breasts.

I guess the goal is for me to join in on the ""in-crowd"" joke and to help subvert the purpose of language. But I refuse to participate.

Have a nice day."

2020-07-20 16:39:18,nzodd,"According to the wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Garfield_characters#Lyman):

&gt;In The Garfield Show episode ""Long Lost Lyman"" (season 3), an effort is made to explain what became of the character in-continuity. Lyman is said to have left Odie with Jon before moving away to work as a wildlife photographer in a distant jungle.[9] When Jon learns that Lyman disappeared while searching for a mythical Bigfoot-like creature, Jon, Garfield, and Odie travel to the jungle to find him. The ""Long Lost Lyman"" version of Lyman has round eyes resembling Jon's rather than the dot-eyes of his traditional comics design and is voiced by Frank Ferrante.[10] 

In other words, that's not even the *real* Lyman but some kind of imposter. Possibly even a r/fleshgait."

How much fucking kool-aid have you overdosed with?. I'm not the one who needs to wake up. We have so many laughs at your expense. The utter dogshit you post.

2020-07-20 12:30:08,[deleted],"We must have different definitions of spam. Am I mistaken in thinking that spam should involve at least two posts?

Buddy. Dude. What you think you know about me is shit. I'm posting on this subreddit because it is the 'anything goes' subreddit these days. Literally no politics is discussed here anymore. So either I'm one of many people posting whatever they want to the 'anything goes' subreddit, or I'm one of many trolls trying to ruin a political subreddit that doesn't actually exist anymore. Oh- trolls and e-thots. Or are all the onlyfans posts on here working for Trump as well? If I were a troll trying to ruin political discourse I'd be posting elsewhere, because there's no political discourse here to ruin.

So there is at least one alternative to ""automatically a troll"". Now do yourself a favour, look at my account, try and fit your narrative to it. I mean if I am a troll, then that account is a masterpiece of covert ops worthy of study. There is absolutely nothing to suggest anything but some dude takling about stuff he's interested in.... UNTIL he slipped up by posting a picture of his dog, exposing a conspiracy that runs right to the bottom of r/world_politics

*edit* I just realized earlier you meant ""no collusion"" not ""no collision"" right? In reference to the impeachment? That I vocally supported? I mean in this whole time you haven't even wondered what I have to say about Trump? Who I consider to be the worst and most dangerous world leader in generations?"

I'm guessing you consider yourself an intelligent, critical thinking person. This is a great opportunity for you to test and display your skills. Look through my post and comment history, and develop the narrative that makes sense of how the guy who has posted 13 times in 2 years, mostly about games and his dog, and who frequently comments in favour of left-wing politics is a right-wing subversive agent.

Obviously if I'm a troll or something my account was set up to look like a real person right? Or to gaslight people and shit? But you'd be able to figure out how it all makes sense and see the web of lies behind the veneer of Bossdogs. I'm genuinely inviting you to. Look at my comments and posts, and critically ask yourself- Is there even the remotest chance this person is committing subversive actions when he posts pics of his dog? Or does he just like his dog?"

If i wanted porn i'd go onto gone wild or another subreddit like that.
