It may sound strange to someone used to colour being the main differentiating factor, but there are many different ethnicities  of black people, and while we could argue all day what counts as a race and if that is the same as racism among people with different coloured skins, it is just as real, and just as problematic. 

To be clear i'm not trying to downplay racism against black people, just pointing out that while skin colour, being such a visible difference, can amplify racism, it is by no means a prerequisite."

2020-06-25 18:51:27,GreatRolmops,"Again, money isn't a finite supply, it isn't a zero-sum game. It is not like the only way to get more wealth into an economy is by taking it away from other economies. It is possible to generate wealth (that is value) from nothing. If a company designs a new product that people then buy, new wealth is generated. If a company finds a new market for an existing product, then new wealth is generated. If a company takes raw resources and turns them into a product more valuable than the sum of its parts, new wealth is generated. And then governments and banks can just print more money to keep up with the increased demand.

To illustrate this: imagine a restaurant. How does a restaurant contribute to an economy? It takes raw resources (agricultural produce) and labor and then turns these into tasty meals for people to consume. The meal is worth more than the sum of its parts, and so new wealth has been created and the GDP of the country increases."

2020-06-25 17:59:55,Langernama,"#Michel Barnier: The moment of truth about the deal with Britain comes in October

The “moment of truth” for a trade deal between Britain and the European Union will come in October, when the bloc’s 27 leaders will hold a summit and want to see a draft agreement, said EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.

This will give the parties time to ratify any agreement before the end of the transition period for Britain at the end of the year, Barnier said at a video conference at the European Political Center in Brussels on Wednesday.

Although there has been little progress in the negotiations, Barnier said an agreement could still be reached, but warned that the UK would have to honor the commitments it made in a political declaration from last year’s Brexit deal.

“We need clear signals now, what Britain intends to do”, said Michel Barnier ahead of another round of talks that begins on Monday. “If we receive signals next week and make progress in July, even better – but it will mean progress on all topics”, added he.

The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson said that he saw no reason why a deal could not be reached in July and did not want the talks to continue after the summer. London has rejected EU demands for the same fishing rights it enjoys today and for a level playing field that would uphold Britain in line with some of the bloc’s rules.

Barnier said the ball was already “in the UK field”, but both sides would have to compromise."

2020-06-25 17:22:33,Teddyismydawg,"more than happy to answer, an easy example is that people born in very rural rural areas have much lower access to education. the people born in these areas often have to move to boarding school locations for what would be the US equivalent of high school and don’t always have access or monetary means to acquire transportation. also, generally speaking people in rural areas of China don’t have the level of educational attainment that people in cities do. 

ex: ~1/3rd of Chinese students don’t complete middle school and another 1/3rd of high school students don’t complete their education either.* another thing is access to healthcare, I don’t exactly have statistics on this one and I know coming from a family with a lot of American healthcare workers it’s an issue here as well, but in rural areas in China hospitals and clinician access are even more rare than here. I’d have to dig for some articles on this one, but I know a lot of rural Chinese families have to move to larger cities to gain access to educational and other social programs for their children’s sake. they often don’t so much reap the benefits afforded to larger cities themselves as their children do. additionally, the rate of homelessness in mainland China is almost identical to the US and is actually a little higher than here. that being said, I don’t think we’re doing enough to combat homelessness here either, them being close to us in this manner is a knock on both countries. neither of us has a realistic excuse for it.

fwiw: I was fortunate enough to complete a student ambassadorship to China and Hong Kong as a teen, and used military educational benefits to complete an exchange program in Hong Kong in college. I really loved the people, but even in cities I can’t think of many places where I’ve witnessed such stark and immediate changes in wealth as I have in say Beijing or Shanghai between city blocks (Hong Kong is another animal and while has inequality issues, it never seemed nearly as bad, even compared to the US and requires an entirely different post to discuss). I’m also saying this as someone who has lived very close to or in two major US cities and a couple of more rural areas/small towns.

2020-06-25 17:17:19,mittro70_,"COVID-19 has assured that most of the flashpoints in the world are either inert or have at least shifted to low-key modes. Except for one that is, Libya. As the world battles the deadly pandemic, the civil war in Libya is raging more fiercely than it ever did in the last few years. In the heart of the conflict is the so-called Libyan National Army (LNA), led by renegade General KhalifaHaftar. Supported by Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt, France and Russia, the LNA has laid a siege on capital Tripoli that is currently under the control of the Government of National Accord (GNA), recognised by the United Nations and pro-actively supported by Turkey, Qatar and Italy.

After months of dithering, Haftar decided to push inside the capital. A panicked GNA asked help from Turkey and Qatar, both supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood who are a party to the accord. They promptly airlifted Jihadists from Idleb in Syria to prop up the failing GNA Forces. Russia, on the other hand, sent mercenaries and arms to prop up the LNA.

For the initial few weeks in April and May, the GNA found it hard to exert its will even after massive help from Turkish mercenaries and drones. Russian mercenaries and missiles managed to blow several Turkish drones out of the sky. As the tussle turned into a quagmire, President Putin tried to broker a deal, an armistice followed by a power-sharing agreement.However, Haftar had other ideas.

Haftar, in his naivety, believed that it was his leadership, and not the Russian help, that had the GNA cornered. He decided not only to reject the deal but also went on to unilaterally declare himself the “leader” of entire Libya.

Russia signalled its mercenaries to pull back. And within a week, the GNA had Haftar and his army on the run. Not only was the siege on Tripoli lifted, but the GNA Forces also became emboldened enough to lay siege to Sirte, an LNA bastion. When Putin realised that Haftarhas learnt his lessons, the mercenaries and missiles were back in action and the GNA soon found itself out of depth.

So, what is it that Russia wants in Libya and how is it planning to achieve those goals?

At this point, sources say, Russia appears to believe that there is no military solution in Libya and all the military posturing must have the end goal to achieve a political and diplomatic breakthrough. This is in some contrast to its strategy in Syria where, although still aspiring for the political solution, it has depended heavily on the military way. In Libya, while it wants the Haftar-led LNA to achieve some military victories, it does not want the GNA to collapse and disintegrate into dozens of smaller warring factions of militias. This mindset has till now driven Russian military calculations on the ground in Libya.

The military support provided by Russia to Haftar has a more short-term goal as well. Because Haftar is supported by Saudis, UAE, Egypt and Russia, sources say there is a sort of friendly competition between all these countries to increase their geopolitical influence inside the LNA. However, unlike UAE, Saudis and Egypt, Russia doesn’t want the LNA to secure decisive victory and the GNA to collapse. It wants the door to remain open for future reconstruction contracts that it will get once a diplomatic solution is reached between the GNA and the LNA.

Russia, on its part, also believes that General Haftarcannot unite entire Libya and therefore he can only be part of a future solution in Libya but not the solutionitself. Russian support, according to the sources, was under the belief that the LNA shall be strong enough for the GNA to take it seriously for diplomatic negotiations.

Sources also confirm that Russia has provided the Eastern and Southern Libyan government (Eastern-based Parliament) of which the LNA is a part with much-needed cash. There was a massive liquidity crunch because of the fall in oil prices. Russia stepped in to relieve the situation in lieu of a deal that will get Moscow pumping rights in some of the oil wells in the region as well as revival of the agreement that Colonel Gaddafi had with Russia where Russia had the right to a military base (naval) in Libya. The assurances in this regard havebeen provided by the government in the East and sources say that a formal deal has either been signed or will be signed in the weeks to come.

Russia has found Haftar frustrating to manage. By declaring himself the Head of entire Libya, Haftar has technically mounted a coup not only against the GNA but also against his own Eastern-based Parliament. This has made it further difficult for his benefactors such as Egypt and Russia to overtly help him militarily.

Sources have confirmed that under the circumstances, while still militarily supporting Haftar, Russia has started exploring the implementation of its Plan B and Plan C.

The Plan B and Plan C of Russia are unfolding intandem. Plan C is to feel out Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a possible replacement to Haftar, or at least as a parallel force to Haftar. This is being done by Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner Group himself. Sources say that contact has been established at this point with no further development.

However, Plan B is in full swing. Russia wants the Eastern-based Parliament in Tabrouk under Saleh Issaand Abdullah al-Thani, the head of the Interim Government in the East, to join ranks to sideline Haftar. This is a very interesting move. First of all, unlike Haftar, both Thani and Saleh are in Russia’s good books and exclusively under its influence. While Russia has to jostle with Saudi, UAE and Egypt for influence over Haftar, in the case of Saleh and Thani, it is miles ahead of the others. Russia wants these two individuals and the institution they represent to start a peace talk with the GNA bypassing Haftar. This will not only clip the wings of Haftar but will also give strength to the Eastern-based Parliament and the Interim Government in the East to exert its dominance over the military wing led by Haftar. This entire file is being overseen by a Russian interlocutor named Stanislav Kudryashov. This guy has excellent relationships with both Thani and Saleh and is the primary brain behind Plan B.

Despite supporting opposing sides in Libya, Turkey and Russia are cooperating behind the scene on several issues. Russia has a line of negotiation opened with the GNA as well, particularly Interior Minister FathiBashagha. This file is being overseen by a Russian individual named Lev Dengov. The Russian-Turkish cooperation in this theatre is to manage the situation where, while the LNA remains a force to reckon with, in the event of any future peace accord, the government must secure Turkish interest including the Demarcation Accord in the Mediterranean struck between Turkey and the GNA.

Sources say that negotiations are taking place between Turkey and Russia that ensures the Demarcation Accord in the Mediterranean holds and, in lieu, Russia is awarded the contract to build the Benghazi-Sirte railway route. The contract is expected to be to the tune of over $3 billion. While this quid-pro-quo deal is still very far from being a reality, it is being discussed. And once again, Turkey and Russia appear to have found some common ground to talk about.

Turkey is very keen that Russia is on board over stopping any division of Libya. While Egypt, UAE and Saudis have no qualms if Libya is divided, Russia and Turkey don’t want this situation. They have their separate motives, however. While for Russia, this will mean that its dream of a naval base is gone as that area will fall into the GNA’s area of operation, Turkey’s own Demarcation Accord in the Mediterranean will become invalid as that line of demarcation will fall under the LNA’s side. Therefore, it is in the interest of both Turkey and Russia to not let Libya get divided.

Whatever be the results of all these manoeuvrings, there’s at least one thing that has been made sure. This is probably the only global conflict in the last 100 years where western powers are not in the driving seat. And that is not due to a lack of will but because they have been muscled out."

Im not the greatest economist so if it seems simple and I missed it I'm sorry but the money flows from companies--&gt;workers--&gt;government--&gt;state employees/any public expense in parallele with straight up company--&gt; government. It's a closed economy inward while outward citizens are free to buy stuff internationally which brings currency outside the country. Service economies work because companies usually go international and ultimately bring profits made in other countries to their home country which will then be taxed. So in our situation seeing as there's a growing ""avoid china"" tendency the number of things they can export will be shrinking won't it? And if it shrunk too much, while the money flowing outward of the country stays the same or grows because of a growing middle class being able to afford better good, isint that bad for the country?"

&gt; 2 min read. MOSCOW - Polls opened in Russia on Thursday for a week-long vote on constitutional changes that would allow President Vladimir Putin to stay in power until 2036.

&gt; Holding the vote in the middle of a pandemic has elicited public health concerns, because Russia is still reporting over 7,000 new virus cases daily and has 606,000 confirmed infections in all, the third-worst caseload in the world.

&gt; The Kremlin has repeatedly dismissed these concerns, saying that Russia was able to slow down the epidemic and assuring people that all necessary measures have been to ensure the safety of the voters.

You don't need trade and foreign investment to bring in new money. Money isn't finite, economy isn't a zero-sum game (meaning you can generate wealth without it coming at the expense of someone else). What matters most for the Chinese (or the US or any other country relying primarily on an internal service market) government is that a service economy does bring a lot of money into the government's coffers through taxation. People work and get paid a salary. The government taxes this and gets a cut of the salary. People then spend this money on groceries, luxury goods and services. The government taxes all of those transactions. The companies who provide those goods and services make a profit. The government taxes that profit. The companies use their profits to pay their workers (taxes!) and to develop and deliver new goods and services and thus generate even more profits (more taxes!). And if you have a massive population and many companies, the government's revenue from taxes will also be absolutely massive."

con·cen·tra·tion camp

noun: concentration camp; plural noun: concentration camps

**a place where large numbers of** people, especially political prisoners or members of **persecuted minorities, are deliberately imprisoned in a relatively small area with inadequate facilities**, sometimes to provide forced labor or to await mass execution.

Just because we stop short of the last qualifiers of **sometimes** forcing labor or executing people...does not mean that we don't have concerntration camps in the US.

2020-06-25 13:24:39,OrganicMemer,USA bad? What an original opinion to have on reddit. Color me surprised.
2020-06-25 13:18:45,gxs007_2,"Most of us (Indians) still pride ourselves in our diversity, secularism and inclusivity. 

But there are many complex reasons why even a diverse multicultural country might side with Modi, the following are some that I can think of:

1.	A small percent of far right individuals exist in each country, similar to Qanon believers in the US. Unfortunately these are the most vocal. 
2.	INC is the party of Nehru and Gandhi and did ride the freedom wave for a substantial portion of India’s history. They did some good things, some bad and people just wanted a change. The only other option was BJP. 
3.	People vote differently in state and central elections.  Although India has a multitude of regional parties and the diversity in state governments does show that to some extent, when it comes to the Center, only two parties are feasible contenders, INC and BJP. If you look at the curious case of AAP, they ran on socialist reforms like free healthcare and better free education( both areas where they did a commendable job) AAP won the Delhi state elections but lost miserably in central elections. 
4.	Some issues are so important to some people that they turn a blind eye to everyone thing. The most prominent of these issues are Pakistan and Ram Janmabhoomi(not stepping in that minefield, google it yourself)
5.	When Modi won in 2014, congress was had been ruling since a long time and many senior ministers got caught up in a of financial scandals. After winning the 2014 election BJP did all it could to make sure it won every following election. They were swimming in money, they set up troll farms and IT cells. Massive disinformation campaigns. Similar to what the Republican Party does in the US. 
6.	They did some good work which was enough for some people to overlook everything else
7.	Competition from INC is non existent because their main guy is , well, ummm, different. 

So no, India is having a bit of a rough patch( not the first) like US et all but in the long term I have complete faith in fellow Indians to move this country in the right direction as it has been for the past 7 decades."

2020-06-25 12:56:00,dekachin5,"&gt;Japanese internment camps in WW2? Mexican internment camps right now?

- The internment wasn't even that big of a deal. It's only seen as bad through the lens of modern politics. The US had a valid reason to require that ethnic Japanese stay away from the west coast at a time when Americans feared sabotage and attacks from Japan. The internees were well treated and free to leave at any time as long as they had somewhere to go outside the exclusion zone.

- ""Mexican internment camps"" are actually just jails housing illegal immigrants (not just Mexicans) pending deportation. There is nothing improper with the US enforcing its immigration laws. Again, they are well treated and given rights/due process.

- Chinese Communist mass-incarceration prisons in Xinjiang, on the other hand, are a [genocidal parade of horrors](https://note.com/tomomishimizu/n/n3e98fa71dc4e), where the CCP rapes and tortures millions for the crime of being from a non-Han ethnic minority in territory that is not historically Chinese but that the CCP wants to cement its hold on. It's genuine orwellian horror by which the CCP seeks to break an entire people in mind and body, crushing them for no better reason than to undermine any effort by these very distinct people to obtain autonomy should the CCP suffer a loss of power down the road. It's not like the land or country has any great strategic value or resources, either, it's just that the CCP is desperate to grab any land it can in service of its imperial ambitions."

And a large part of their economy is based on housing, which is why you'll see ""ghost cities"". You have several apartments, one of which you live in. You sell an apartment so your son can get married, then you sell another so you can by a new apartment for the couple.

Housing has essentially become currency, and that is simply not sustainable."

&gt; Atheists and humanists are facing discrimination and persecution in some countries because of their beliefs and values, according to a new report.

&gt; Non-religious people in Colombia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines and Sri Lanka are often ostracised, and some women are forced into marriages, says Humanists At Risk: Action Report 2020, published on Thursday by Humanists International.

&gt; Gary McLelland, the chief executive of Humanists International, said: &amp;quot;This report shines a light on the targeted violence, continued harassment and social discrimination faced by humanists in many countries and opens the door to conversations on how best to protect humanists worldwide. What is clear is that all laws and policies which criminalise &amp;#039;blasphemy&amp;#039; should be repealed.""

2020-06-25 10:44:34,Not-Jessica,"First off, thank you for that. Part of it was just plain funny. 

But I will point out that a peer-reviewed journal is not automatically a journal of quality. In fact, the authors of this hoax planned a rerun with journals of better repute just to address this particular critique. (I’m not sure what the outcome of this was; if I remember correctly, some of them got in trouble with their universities for fraudulently representing some colleagues to get past reviewers.)

I won’t argue that the entire hoax was pointless for this reason. Of course it speaks to the need for more rigour in academic publications in the social sciences. But I will keep going back to the claim that you originally made, that results are actively suppressed when they’re deemed undesirable by their authors. You still haven’t addressed it at all, and I doubt that you can or will. If the authors of his hoax had done solid research that supported “inconvenient” conclusions and then had been refused by journals for this, then that would have supported your original claim. 

Some journals on the lower end of clout and repute accepted sub-par papers. The authors of those hoax papers acknowledged this critique by aiming for journals of better quality. None of that proves that the academia is conspiring to not publish ‘inconvenient’ results from actually robust studies for ideological reasons. 

I’m not up for deconstructing every article or study you find tangentially related to your original claim. Unless you‘re trying to address your specific accusation that good quality studies or articles aren’t published because of ideological reasons, I can’t respond anymore."

&gt; Recent Chinese boycotts have targeted things like Australian beef or Houston Rockets games, but not more vital commodities.

&gt; Today China prefers to use its coastguard, its maritime militia and other agencies to bully neighbours.

Service based economy targeting inside markets won't bring in any new currency in the country, and since they are doing everything in their power to lose their international reputation, it doesn't seem like they are such a hotspot of investing especially since corona.

Now they could counter that by exporting stuff they have a monopoly on like the current situation with rare minerals, but natural ressources always have a cap and ultimately technology is the best bet. Technology, which they have famously started acquiring through national commercial spy agencies further damaging their reputation. Not even at the sweatshop level, companies manufacturing more complex goods don't want to go to china since they will inevitably get their secrets stolen (see the Norton case and many others). While it used to be silent from the rest of the world, it's starting to change with stories like Australia calling them out on it only for China to try and flex muscle, FURTHER DESTROYING THEIR REPUTATION. 

Couple that with the economic bubble the CCP has led china into, economic isolation will be the last nail in the coffin of the CCP. At least they will have coffins because while you mention that grown middle class, do remember it's not that sweet. Elders across china are turning to suicide because of the sheer number of that demographic. While they would traditionally be supported by their children's until their passing, the fact that the age demographic pyramid in china has heavily shifted toward the elders because of the one child policy has lead to situations where people literally go in the wild to die and not be a burden to their children (funeral treatment are a luxury in some parts of china because of the number of elders dying and space being limited.). But that's not all, because those who do not go down that path are an even greater drag down the CCP. In recent years, China has tried in every way possible to legally bring traditional Chinese medicine (ex:ginger soup will cure all your ills) as the same status as modern medicine, because paying universal modern healthcare for such a huge populations and an ever aging population is impossible and they know it.

All this has led to a very fragile status quo which pushed the CCP to crack down HARD on anything that could go break it (hong kong for instance). So while we are used to hearing stuff like: The Chinese bubble will collapse soon etc, I do believe that what happened with civil unrest in 2019 followed by the largest global pandemic in a century bred in that country, has undoubtedly shown to us that it WILL happen.

2020-06-25 06:20:28,GreatRolmops,"I got the ideas from this Reuters column I read back in March written by John Kemp, a well-known market analyst.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/china-economy-kemp/column-chinas-internal-not-export-market-matters-more-for-world-economy-john-kemp-idUSL8N2AW6LX](https://www.reuters.com/article/china-economy-kemp/column-chinas-internal-not-export-market-matters-more-for-world-economy-john-kemp-idUSL8N2AW6LX)

2020-06-25 06:14:24,jargondonut,Central America? Because some communications might flow through the US? That would be true for any country.
2020-06-25 06:13:45,TheDovahofSkyrim,Source?
2020-06-25 06:12:05,GreatRolmops,"Actually, it is mostly those prices why the capitalists are moving their production out of China. China has changed a lot over the past 20 years. It is no longer a poor, developing country. But as China develops and standards of living there increase, so do the salaries that the capitalists need to pay and therefore the costs of producing there.

This means that since China has gotten expensive the capitalists are now starting to move on to cheaper countries with lower salaries and standards of living (like Vietnam, India or Bangladesh).

To China however, this is no longer a concern. Because China has developed so much, it now has a large, moderately wealthy middle class and a very wealthy upper class that constitute a massive internal market. This means that China has shifted from becoming a country whose economy is focused on manufacturing, export and international trade to a country whose economy (like that of the US) is focused on fulfilling the demands of the internal market. In other words, China went from being reliant on selling stuff to other countries to being reliant on selling stuff to its own people.

This means that China no longer has to be so careful about its reputation. Like the US, they can now afford to take off the kid gloves and bully and upset other countries in pursuit of their interests without having to fear that this will ruin their trade and economy."

2020-06-25 06:06:28,powerfulinheels,"Yes, that lies at the center of each action. Also it's one of the few countries that never truly had political liberties like the right to vote or protest, so it's unlikely things are going to change. Very few Chinese people I met even recognize the value of any political action."
2020-06-25 06:04:48,randomnighmare,This is pretty much what China thinks currently. They don't care and they know that nothing will be done about it because they are the world's factory. Not only that but I am sure that China has a plan B just in case sanctions do happen. But they literally think they can get away with all of this.

2020-06-25 06:03:21,MiG-25,"It's actually pretty interesting if you have nothing to do and want to look into it. [Here's](https://www.mercer.com/newsroom/global-pension-index-reveals-who-is-the-most-and-least-prepared-for-tomorrows-ageing-world.html) a comparison of pensions around the world. The Netherlands comes at first place among the countries listed, while Argentina comes at last."
2020-06-25 05:58:27,GreatRolmops,"China does not rely on trade with other countries to stay afloat. That maybe was so in the 1990's and early 2000's, but that time is long past. Present-day China has the largest single market of any country in the world (only the EU is larger but that is not a single country). All countries depend partially on trade for their economy, but Chinese companies are probably literally the least reliant on foreign trade compared to companies from anywhere else in the world. Foreign trade only generates about 20% of China's GDP (according to the World Bank). Compare this with countries like Germany (47%) or South Korea (43%) that are much more reliant on the international economy.

China definitely has weaknesses, but the economy is not one of them. It is in fact probably the biggest strength of China."

2020-06-25 05:52:40,MiG-25,"There used to be a bigger system in the 80s called the Iron Rice bowl, basically the state took care of you from birth to death. 

Nowadays there's a 2 tier plan, a basic and employee contribution part. The basic one is based off province wide average wages and prices. This is interesting because what one worker in a rural province gets paid could be miles away from what someone in Beijing gets. Regardless, the basic pension is typically extremely low and not nearly enough to actually retire off of. This leaves the defined contribution plan, in which employees contribute 8% and employers contribute 20%. 

What's interesting is that the retirement age is 60 for men and 55 for women, with some circumstances allowing it to go down to 55 and 50 (there must however be at least 15 years of contribution). This is quite lower than many other country's retirement ages and probably won't be sustainable in the future."

2020-06-25 05:25:41,MiG-25,"The most simple solution is simply to reduce pensions and benefits for old people, though that would be unpopular. They can also try to do what Russia and Singapore do and provide monetary benefits for people to have babies. China's problem comes from the fact that they have a ton of people with a ton of babies, and then suddenly the number of babies stopped while life expectancy rose by 20 something years. So you end up with old people who are living longer with lower amounts of young people to support them, similar to what we have with Social Security but on a China-size scale."

2020-06-24 23:43:25,Oblivion_Wonderlust,"Who the fuck made you the arbiter of the hierarchy of experiments? Data is data.

Sociology does not just make stuff up, it is based observation and statistical analysis.

Also, surveys and polls is how advertising and marketers collect data. That’s aren’t any huge labs with white walls where they isolate people and stick electrodes in their brains to get their response. They just ask people what they feel about a product.

&gt;	For example, objectification is literally just an opinion with no backing whatsoever. There is no evidence sexy women in media makes men treat women worse.

“Sexy women exist in media” is not objectification, dumbass. It’s not only a part of gender studies but also media studies.

Objectification is when characters, in most cases female, are not ascribed agency within a piece of media and are treated somewhat like robots and only exist as either a love interest or a plot device. This then affects the psyche of young men who consume this media (surely you’re not a complete imbecile who doesn’t think that media has any affect on people). 

r/NiceGuys is full of examples of guys who have been affected by this trope, these dudes believe that women are incapable of making choices for themselves and believe that if they input niceness into women, sex should pop out. That is what objectification is, not “sexy women exist”.

This just shows how ignorant you are. One day your thought-daddy came out and said “gender studies bad” and you were just like “yeah that feels right”. 

You don’t know the first thing about science and data collection and interpretation."

2020-06-24 23:11:26,rtechie1,"&gt;&gt;	There is very little within gender studies that is based on credible scientific experiments, as opposed to surveys or opinion polls.
&gt;
&gt;Surveys and polls are in fact valid and credible scientific experiments and fall under the category of natural and field experiments (as opposed to controlled experiments) and utilise multivariable analyses (rather than isolating a given variable as done in lab experiments) to make and test predictions.

I'm not getting into this debate. If you can't admit that type of research is inferior to controlled experiments we're done. 

&gt;This is because it would be virtually impossible as well as excessively expensive to perform said experiments in a controlled environment.

Tough. Particle colliders cost a ton of money but physicists don't just make up stuff. This is a really lame excuse. 

&gt;You can’t just take a thousand babies and feed some of them a different diet for 80 years to see how many on that diet have good hearts.

Why not? Because it's *hard*? Yeah, science can be difficult. It's better for a scientist to spend their entire life generating one fact then to spew out endless papers of poorly researched nonsense. 

&gt;Gender studies, like all social sciences are concerned with how people affect the society they are in and how people are effected by the society in which they live, therefore, the best method of data collection for these sciences is going out and asking people what they think about a certain subject. This is very similar to how experiments are conducted in fields like economics.

Opinion surveys aren't science. Is political polling science? What's the difference? 

&gt;Hypotheses and theories made by social-sciences are both testable and repeatable and are employed in fields like Advertising, Marketing, and Human Resource Management. 

Yes, advertising has spent many decades and spent billions on **controlled experiments** to establish facts about persuasion. Such that we understand the science of persuasion pretty well. That's exactly how psychology should work. 

However stuff like Meyers-Briggs, popular in HR, are garbage. 

&gt;You could, if you wanted, go out and test the hypotheses made by gender-studies scholars and get the same results.

They literally just make things up. How could I get the same results? 

For example, objectification is literally just an opinion with no backing whatsoever. There is no evidence sexy women in media makes men treat women worse."

Stop being so pedantic. They arrested and threatened the man for the crime of telling people about an imminent pandemic. He saved lives. They punished him for it. Awfully cunty behavior if you ask me.

China, meanwhile, killed people. They let sick folks get planes knowing they were sick. They cornered the market for PPE. They destroyed lab results, hid the extent of the contagion, and refused to share early data on the virus. It's hard to imagine how they could have fucked over the world any harder than they already did. Basically, cunts."
2020-06-24 22:51:12,rtechie1,"&gt;If you’re a strict positivist and criticise gender studies for its methods, I’ll assume you don’t consider anthropology, history, sociology, psychology, philosophy, economics, law, or cultural studies as real science either.

Philosophy is based on logical arguments, evidence and bad research aren't really a concern. Philosophy does not claim to be science. 

History, economics, law, and cultural studies do not claim to be science. 

But anthropology, sociology, and psychology DO claim to be science. They are ""soft"" sciences and generate huge amounts of bad data. They are not on the same level as ""hard"" sciences like physics. 

&gt;And in that case you’re just taking a side in a debate that’s gone on for decades if not centuries already in academia. 

You'd be right. As an engineer and computer scientist you can guess which side I'm on. 

&gt;And it’s not a particularly worthwhile discussion to be honest, because we do need other professions besides physicists, chemists, and engineers.

Sure, for example, psychologists are basically priests and priests certainly have a social function. So do strippers. I don't claim strippers are scientists."

*****
&gt; The report released by Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, concerning the Taliban and other associated individuals and entities, published in the EU Chronicle, stated that the fighters trained by Pakistan-based terror outfits such as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba act as advisers, trainers and specialists in improvised explosive devices in Afghanistan.

&gt; Pakistan&amp;#039;s ambitions for Afghanistan and the support of its Inter-Intelligence Services to Pak based terrorist organisations, as per the UN report implies that it too wants to be included in the race for control.

&gt; Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, in July 2019, on his three-day official visit to Washington, admitted to American lawmakers that successive governments in his country previously had not told the truth to the United States, in particular over the past 15 years where forty different militant groups were operating in Pakistan.

2020-06-24 19:48:57,silvergoldwind,That’s an easy one for anybody willing to put in the effort to find links. They were selling off natural resources to foreign investors and curbing civil rights prior to China’s takeover.
2020-06-24 19:47:30,burtzev,"So basically Portugal is saying ""no deal until you straighten out"". Sounds like a long wait. The history of these restrictions, especially in the USA, can be described as ""wild"". The US restriction on travel from Europe originally exempted Ireland and the UK. In a few days the sane people in Washington managed to get through the fog in the brain of you-know-who and point out that you can't exempt countries just because you have golf courses there. Ireland and the UK were added.

More seriously you-know-who has twice tried to destroy the US agriculture industry by banning farm workers from Mexico, which  still has far less of a problem than the USA does. Well, you can imagine the phone calls and emails to the DOA. This was also walked back - twice. No doubt he'll try again. 

My favourite was the ""US troops on the Canadian border"" scheme to prevent the hordes of illegals trying to sneak into Plague Central from another country with a far better coronavirus record. It didn't go over well. That was also walked back. Perhaps Canada threatened to mobilize their massive army of beavers, loons and moose to jump on their snowmobiles and put an end to the Washington Regime. White House burning #2 ?"

You would not, actually, and that is what the data shows: broadcast news - which is seen as less partisan - has higher scores.

[Negative. They realized they were fucked in ww2 if they didn't keep trading with the nazis, so they just kept doing so under the guise  We aRe NeUtRaL and we don't want to be invaded](http://www.historyisnowmagazine.com/blog/2016/2/14/was-switzerland-neutral-or-a-nazi-ally-in-world-war-two#.XvNV9GkpCDY=)

&gt;Prior to WWII, Switzerland had relied heavily on trade with Germany to build a strong and economically powerful nation. It was an industrialized country with virtually no raw materials, experiencing the same economic depression that was felt throughout both Europe and America. When World War Two commenced, Switzerland worried that any non-cooperation would lead to a cease in vital trade and even more significantly, an invasion. As it was completely surrounded by Nazi controlled countries, the Swiss had two choices: cooperate with Nazi trade policies or fight against them.
Between the years of 1939 and 1945, roughly 10,276,000 tons of coal was transported from Germany to Switzerland and provided 41% of Switzerland’s energy requirement. This demonstrates how the Swiss were keen to stay on good terms with Germany to continue their vital trade.
One thing Switzerland provided to the Nazis in return for important materials was access to the railway that ran through Switzerland and connected Italy and Germany. In the event of an invasion, the Swiss army planned to destroy vital tunnels and bridges, immobilizing the railway for years and making transportation between Italy and Germany nearly impossible. To uphold their neutral stand, Switzerland’s governments laid down restrictions on what could be transported over their railway. The Swiss would only allow sealed boxes to pass through without checking their contents, in exchange for raw materials and trade. Officially, the Swiss banned any transportation of people (troops) or war goods over their railway, but the extent to which this was upheld is very questionable."

2020-06-24 15:30:07,lapse_of_taste,"&gt;purely normative? like ""human rights are good""? no. 

Political philosophy uses arguments, not just assertions, and that's historically where important debates took place. Like, the political ideologies that shape the world were debated in formal academic settings for millenia, and now we have to throw them out because you think writing on normative issues is...immature? Dangerous? Dishonorable? A waste of time?

The debate between libertarians and social democrats needs to take place somewhere, whether that's (preferably) an academic setting or a Youtube comment thread.

&gt;""we hypothesize that an increase of human rights as defined by powers et al. has a benefit on quality of life. to test this, we take markers of quality of life in 40 countries and estimate the correlation with the human right index as presented by müller et al. we find that..."" 

And quality of life is not a normative criterion? The problem with your suggestion is that either you are sneaking a normative standard in through the backdoor, or you are just going to present a meaningless correlation between variables no one cares about.

In fact, if you want to cleanse academia from normativity, you'd need to throw out large chunks of psychology and medicine too. It may be uncontroversial to think that depression is bad, but to say that there is no moral reasoning motivating research would be false. 

&gt;in mathematics, imo, its always worth it to research. mostly because sooo many applications pop up, often unexpected.

Can we generalize that sentiment to other academic fields? Or do you think that we should throw out Babylonian history because it's the study of a dead culture?"

&gt;&gt;That's a myth

It's not a ""myth"", it's the [leading theory on the origin of COVID and the only one with evidence backing it up.](https://www.independentsciencenews.org/health/the-case-is-building-that-covid-19-had-a-lab-origin/) See also [this explanation from a biologist](https://youtu.be/pRCzZp1J0v0?t=6881).

&gt;corona is not a lab-grown / artificial virus.

Nobody ever said it was. That is a straw man. The Wuhan labs were studying bat coronaviruses harvested from nature, which they forcibly subjected to accelerated evolution known as [""gain of function""](https://www.vox.com/2020/5/1/21243148/why-some-labs-work-on-making-viruses-deadlier-and-why-they-should-stop) research to breed viruses that could infect humans. The idea being that if you force the virus to rapidly evolve to something capable of causing a human pandemic, you can study it and develop countermeasures to prevent said pandemic. 

The problem is when you create the very monster you were trying to prevent, and then unleash it on the world.

&gt;And it's not the first virus either that has managed the jump from bats and other animal reservoirs, look up ""zoonosis"".

There is no evidence at this point that COVID jumped from bats to humans out in the wild. There is considerable evidence that transmission arose from Wuhan labs studying coronaviruses.

&gt;China has managed to reasonably contain outbreaks now

&gt;Why do Icelanders keep electing these coalitions that keep collapsing?
&gt;Iceland is a microstate of some 300,000, in which outrage reverberates quickly through the Internet echo chamber. Despite having an elected president with some policymaking authority, Iceland is mostly a parliamentary democracy where coalition governments are common. In recent cycles, the multiparty system has included several new parties, such as the Pirate Party, which have shaken up the system. Put these together and it explains the new volatility within Iceland’s system. But it doesn’t account for the repeated implosion of male-led, right-leaning governments.

At the time of this comment, my comment you replied to is at -8. The CCP shills are out in force tonight.

If you aren't aware of the extensive evidence in favor of the lab release theory, which is at this point the dominant theory, you simply haven't been paying attention.

[Here is one link with some evidence and explanation.](https://www.independentsciencenews.org/health/the-case-is-building-that-covid-19-had-a-lab-origin/) 

A lot of the stupidity in the media supposedly ""debunking"" that the CCP ""created"" the virus in a lab comes from the fact that you can't put together a virus in a lab like it's made of LEGOs. The COVID virus evolved from a natural virus, obviously. Thing is, the Wuhan labs were conducting ""gain of function"" research where the lab researchers were purposely evolving the virus to infect humans so that they could study what a human-infectious coronavirus would look like so they could better fight it if it emerged naturally. This is all well and good, until the virus escaped thanks to negligent containment procedures. The scientists created the very monster they were trying to prevent, and then negligently unleashed it onto humanity.

The Chinese Communist Party, of course, is working overtime to stack the deck against this theory, so there are countless MSM articles claiming it can't be true (without evidence). The fact that Trump and Pompeo came out in favor of it means all the anti-Trump liberals in the media are reflexively against it.

2. I did indeed state that I suspect that communist agitator Martin Gugino chose to fall backwards to exaggerate his injuries to martyr himself.

2020-06-24 10:29:39,VrijeRepubliekTwente,"#EU pushing ahead with digital tax despite US resistance, Vestager says
Brussels would ‘really, really prefer a global consensus,’ but will go it alone ‘if we need to,’ top Commission official says.

The European Union’s powerful antitrust and COVID-19 bailout enforcer says the EU will push ahead with its own digital services tax even if the U.S. sticks to its efforts to block a global deal. European Commission Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager, from Denmark, is the most senior EU official to speak out in the wake of the U.S. withdrawing from negotiations on the tax.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin withdrew June 17 from talks brokered by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which aimed to create a global system for taxing digital services in the country where each transaction takes place — at a rate of at least 2 percent — rather than where the tech company is headquartered.

Vestager’s strong language on the collapsing tax negotiations as well as the broader transatlantic relationship signal the EU is increasingly willing to operate with its elbows out when dealing with the United States, and has all but given up negotiating with the Trump administration.

In a wide-ranging virtual interview, Vestager said the EU would “really, really prefer a global consensus” on digital tax, but will push ahead with a regional tax, “if we need to.”

The new tax is necessary, Vestager argued, due to the ease with which many large tech companies minimize their European taxes. That makes it “so difficult to defend the many, many, many businesses all over the world who pay their taxes,” she said. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told the French Senate this month that the U.S. was the lone holdout on a deal: “We were a few inches from an agreement,” he told local radio.

A frustrated Vestager said that big tech companies are inviting a backlash from both consumers and regulators by repeatedly pushing the limits of EU law. Many of those companies are American, Vestager highlighted, pointing to a long list of antitrust and tax cases against Apple, Amazon and Google as a sign companies are not learning from past EU regulatory tangles.

“I worry that we did not have one Google case: We had two, we had three. We've had one Amazon case, (and) now we have a new one. And we unfortunately had to open (two cases) on Apple.” She added, archly, “There is, I think, still a learning potential.”

U.S. President Donald Trump has previously labeled Vestager the “tax lady” over her decision to force Apple to pay over $14 billion in unpaid taxes to the government of Ireland.

Vestager’s tough line on foreign tech companies operating in Europe is part of her broader goal for “open strategic autonomy,” she said, where the continent pushes back against more aggressive U.S. and Chinese policy postures, maintains open markets, and defends Europe’s “welfare states, universal health care, universal access to education.”

But Vestager also expressed concern that despite shared “fundamental values,” the U.S. and EU are allowing themselves to be divided by China, with severe economic and political consequences.

Vestager said some Chinese companies do not compete “fair and square” and said “there is a huge problem of reciprocity” when it comes to market access in China. EU officials are frustrated that Chinese authorities block foreign companies from bidding for Chinese government projects, while suspecting that Chinese companies benefit from government subsidies, giving them an unfair advantage in the EU’s more open public tender systems.

The frustrations found concrete form last week when the European Commission supported the creation of a legal tool that would allow Brussels to crack down against foreign subsidies, including by blocking acquisitions or banning companies from participating in public tenders.

Vestager hinted that she would not be afraid to use the EU’s new powers once they are finalized. “Where I grew up in the Western part of Denmark, if you invite people over and they don't invite you back, eventually you stop” inviting them, she said.

Another possible solution, she said, would be a joint U.S.-EU “Trade and Technology Council,"" an idea first proposed by the EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan to give Western powers a place to coordinate their position vis-a-vis Chinese technology and commerce. “Right now we are not making best use” of our “shared values and having a common history,” she said.

Vestager conceded, however, that “China is a partner, for instance, on climate change,” and can’t simply be cut loose.

That has complicated the EU's response on issues like human rights in Hong Kong, where the continent has struggled to move from words to action. Joshua Wong, a leader of anti-Beijing protests in Hong Kong, last week accused the EU of running an “appeasement policy” on Hong Kong, to safeguard its economic interests in China. Vestager acknowledged Wong has reason to be frustrated with the EU — “he's in a very difficult situation.”

In the wake of the economic devastation wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic, Vestager has been put in charge of ensuring economic rescue packages passed by governments within the bloc do not unduly distort markets. And she reiterated Tuesday that she is enforcing strict rules on those who receive bailout money.

Conditions on those rescue funds include a “ban of bonuses of senior management, acquisition bans, dividend bans,"" she said, adding that government support must only be offered with clear “sunset clauses.”

Vestager also noted the EU attaches more stringent conditions to using government money to recapitalize or restructure a company than it attaches to short-term offers of liquidity support.

Businesses that were failing before the pandemic will not be allowed to take government money to camouflage their existing weaknesses, she added."

Australia only voted after 122 countries voted that includes most developed and developing countries in the Americas Europe Asia Africa and your New Zealand neigh. As of now the only nation that oppose it(voted against said investigation) is the United States of America who exited the WHO.

**STATEMENT BY THE G-77 AND CHINA IN SUPPORT OF THE WHO IN THE FIGHT AGAINST COVID-19**"

2020-06-24 09:33:00,DCFY7439,"The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump introduced a long-awaited U.N. Security Council (UNSC) draft resolution extending an arms embargo on Iran that is due to expire in October, setting the stage for a great-power clash and likely veto in the U.N.’s principal security body, according to a copy of the draft obtained by Foreign Policy.

The U.S. draft resolution would oblige nations, including the United States, to take active measures to prevent Iran from supplying, selling, or transferring arms to other countries, unless the Security Council committee overseeing U.N. sanctions approves such transfers. The measure would also require all U.N. member states to inspect cargo transiting through their territory to check for illicit arms imports or exports from Iran, and grant them authority to seize and destroy such weapons.

It would also impose an asset freeze and travel ban on individuals responsible for violating the arms embargo, and authorize states to “seize, inspect, freeze (impound), confiscate, and dispose of any vessel in their ports.” In an effort to ratchet up pressure on Iran, the resolution would request that U.N. Secretary General António Guterres report any attacks by armed groups that threaten regional stability or interference in the freedom of navigation in the region. The resolution would also establish a special council committee to monitor compliance with the sanctions and appoint a panel of eight experts to investigate and compile information on potential violations of the embargo.

If passed, the resolution would fall under Chapter VII of the U.N. charter, making it legally binding and enforceable. But the U.S. measure, according to several U.N. Security Council diplomats, stands little chance of being adopted by the 15-nation council. One council diplomat said that the U.S. initiative might not even receive the minimum threshold of nine votes it needs in the council that would force a veto from one of the permanent Security Council members. “This is not something that they are trying to get through the council,” said the diplomat.

Some council diplomats and other nonproliferation experts see the U.S. move as a way to score political points at home, not to do anything about Iran’s destabilizing activities in the region.

“The skeptic in me says that the objective of this exercise is to go through the arms embargo resolution, and when it fails, to use that as an excuse to get a snapback of the embargo, and if and when that fails too, to use as a political talking point in the election campaign,” said Mark Fitzpatrick, a former State Department nonproliferation official now at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Since China and Russia are almost certain to ignore any U.N. arms embargo forced by U.S. maneuvers, the practical impact on Iran’s ability to cause mischief will be minimal, he said.

“It’s not actually about stopping any arms from China and Russia, it’s about winning a political argument,” he said.

The draft also condemns a string of alleged armed attacks by Iran against the United States, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, including the September 2019 drone and missile attack against two Saudi oil installations and a Dec. 27 strike allegedly by an Iranian-backed militia against an Iraqi military base in Kirkuk province, Iraq, which resulted in the death of a U.S. citizen and injured several U.S. and Iraqi personnel.

The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) envisioned the expiration of a sweeping U.N. arms embargo on Iran after five years if Tehran complied with its obligation to scale back its nuclear activities and subject its program to expanded international monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Iran had largely complied with its obligations until Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement in May 2018 and reintroduced a series of U.S. sanctions against the country. 

Since then, Tehran has violated key tenets of the JCPOA, including enriching uranium to purity levels higher than what is allowed in the deal and increasing the stockpiles of enriched uranium, according to assessments from the International Atomic Energy Agency. 

China and Russia, which wield veto power over Security Council decisions, have signaled their unwillingness to approve the resolution. Other signatories of the Iran deal—Britain, France, and Germany—have all supported retaining arms embargoes on Iran, but they also came out against the Trump administration’s threat to reimpose sanctions, highlighting the sharp disagreements between Washington and its closest European allies over Iran. 

“We firmly believe that any unilateral attempt to trigger UN sanctions snapback would have serious adverse consequences in the UNSC,” the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and Germany said in a statement on June 19. “We would not support such a decision which would be incompatible with our current efforts to preserve the JCPoA.”

The foreign ministers also cautioned that lifting the U.N. conventional arms embargo “would have major implications for regional security and stability” but stressed that even without a U.N. arms embargo, the European Union has its own ban on sending conventional weapons and missile technology to Iran through 2023. Senior U.S. officials have said that Russia and China would be poised to sell conventional arms to Iran if the U.N. embargo expires.

A State Department spokesperson told Foreign Policy that “failing to extend the arms embargo will risk even greater violence in the Middle East.”

The spokesperson added that the U.S. is “hopeful” that the draft resolution will be supported by the Security Council, stating that China and Russia have upheld similar restrictions in the past. “Given that Iran’s activity continues to pose a threat to international peace and security, we do not see any reason why [the] Security Council consensus on this issue should have changed,” the spokesperson said.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo argued on Twitter Tuesday that if the arms embargo expires, Iran would be able to purchase Russian and Chinese jets, allowing Tehran to potentially threaten Europe and Asia, though Pompeo used one-way flight ranges for those aircraft to exaggerate their potential threat.

The Trump administration’s push to reimpose sanctions opened a unique legal debate over the United States’ current standing with the JCPOA. The Trump administration has argued that it is still legally a party to the deal the president disavowed, allowing it to trigger the snapback of sanctions. This argument has angered top diplomats from other countries that were signatories to the deal, who said the United States couldn’t have it both ways.

Brian Hook, the Trump administration’s top Iran envoy, said in an interview with Foreign Policy last month that the president remains open to “sitting down” with Tehran for talks on a new deal. He said that the United States would still maintain its expanding sanctions regime on Iran in the meantime. 

“We’re in no hurry. We have a good policy in place. The regime needs to decide when it wants to come to the table,” he said."

&gt; A timely reminder of Saudi Arabia&amp;#039;s current vulnerability to the continued threat that Iran and its proxies pose it - one of the key threats that the deal with Russia would eliminate, the Kremlin has said - came in the form of the attack on Tuesday 23 June when the Saudi-led military coalition fighting in Yemen intercepted and destroyed eight booby-trapped unmanned aircraft that were targeting civilian objects and civilians in Saudi Arabia.

&gt; Russia&amp;#039;s Energy Minister, Alexander Novak, also flagged at the time that Russia gas producer Novatek was in talks for Saudi investors to take part in its Arctic LNG-2 project, a follow-up to its US$27 billion plant in the Yamal peninsula.

&gt; The upshot for Russia was, firstly, that the Saudis rowed back on their demand that Syria&amp;#039;s President Bashar al-Assad be removed from power and, secondly, that Saudi Arabia signed a memorandum of understanding for the purchase from Russia of its S-400 air defense system.

&gt;The decision aims to “preserve an adequate competitive environment, that ensures the functioning of a payment system that’s interchangeable, fast, secure, transparent, open and cheap,” the monetary authority said in a statement on its website. Bank authorities requested that Mastercard Inc. and Visa Inc. stop payment and money transfer activities through the app.

&gt;A suspension without presenting further arguments is “an unusual, extraordinary move by the central bank, especially in payments arrangements and technology market,” said Tiago Severo Gomes, a partner at Caputo, Bastos and Serra and a specialist in fintechs and banking regulation.

I don't know if an entity as big as Facebook can exist in a competitive market, but IDK what the e-payment landscape of Brazil looks like. Whatsapp hasn't done anything wrong except be owned by Facebook (which should warrant the lash but I'm not in charge), but maybe more details are to follow. 

&gt;“Our goal is to provide digital payments to all WhatsApp users in Brazil using an open model and we will continue to work with local partners and the Central Bank to make this possible,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said. ”In addition, we support the Central Bank’s PIX project on digital payments and together with our partners are committed to work with the Central Bank to integrate our systems when PIX becomes available,” the spokesperson said, referring to Brazil’s proposed instant-payment system.

&gt;The company was surprised by the Central Bank’s decision, and the two sides were in regular contact in the run-up to the payments launch, said a person familiar with the talks who asked not to be named discussing private deliberations.

I'm just paranoid but it sounds like a last-minute shakedown for more money cause of the surprise part of it."

I would say there are limits as to what views you can openly hold as a university professor, with obvious examples being racism, sexism etc.

So it's not surprising to me that she was made to leave, especially with how she acted (putting things about how trans women aren't women on her door etc), some more examples and pictures here:

I'm sorry, usually conservatives dislike science and reason, so I can't really see how my comment would indicate I am a political conservative.

If you want to know, instead of trying your very best to reduce someone's entire political approach to a single bite-sized, easy-reading piece of text, I am a social democrat, or a social-libertarian, somewhere in between those two.

I take the position I do on gender ideology because I try to mirror my beliefs with science as much as I can. Science says gender amounts to the fashion of your time and place, and no credible and peer-reviewed paper has yet to provide evidence that it is anything but a societal set of stereotypes. Sex is genetically determined, whether you like that or not.

&gt; SYDNEY - Trust in China among Australians has more than halved amid diplomatic and trade disputes, with only 23% saying they trusted Beijing to act responsibly in the world compared to a 52% reading two years ago, a major poll has found.

&gt; The annual Lowy Institute Poll also found rising support for Australia&amp;#039;s security alliance with the United States, up six points to 78% this year, even though U.S. President Donald Trump was unpopular with Australians.

&gt; While Australians believed the U.S. alliance was important for Australia&amp;#039;s security, Fullilove said &amp;quot;Trust in the United States has stagnated, and few Australians have confidence in President Trump&amp;quot;.

&gt;It's money to be spent which boosts the economy and eventually gets back to the EU through a variety of taxes

I'm not so sure about that. It would only be a fraction of the initial amount, and then only after a period of time. 

&gt;it's not an instant UK left need more cash stat

No, I quite agree. They have reserves after all. It's just 10bn is a non-trivial amount, and I'm a bit puzzled as to where they will find it in the mid term. It's a significant chunk of their revenues, and there's never been a year where the EU spent less than the previous year. Much of their investment goes into things that don't pay a return immediately, and when that return is paid it's not obvious or direct into coffers (as per the German households stat you mention above).

My guess is that the EU don't have a plan to plug this gap (their accounts never pass audit...) and they are assuming (like all politicians) that money will arrive from somewhere. 

Be interesting to see what happens if it doesn't..."

It doesn't help that many on the right (and more recently the left) conflate that with socialism/communism. And with the way the US is structured, I suspect we gotta do it state-by-state in order to keep enough social cohesion to keep it functioning.

2020-06-23 23:22:08,mittro70_,"The Iranian Revolutionary Guards warned, on Tuesday, that it would respond to “any terrorist movements originating from the Kurdistan region of Iraq,” at a time when Turkey is launching a massive attack on what it says are PKK gatherings in northern Iraq, days after targeting villages in northern Erbil, reports The Eastern Herald.

The statements are likely to be related to two main Kurdish groups, the first of which is the Iranian Kurdistan Democratic Party, and the second is the Iranian Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK), which is an extension of the PKK, in addition to other smaller parties, such as the Iranian Kurdistan Kumala Party.

Although the two parties, PJAK and Democrat, are different, whether in terms of strategy or goals, as the Democratic Party wants autonomy for the Kurds in a federal Iran, while “PJAK” raises the slogan of the Kurdish state, Iran treats them equally, often bloody.

“Some terrorist groups infiltrate into Iranian Kurdistan from the Kurdistan region of Iraq,” Commander of the Revolutionary Guards ground commander Major General Muhammad Bakbur said, noting that “Iran will respond to any terrorist movements launched from Iraqi Kurdistan and will not compliment anyone in its national security,” reports The Eastern Herald.

Iran is trying to take advantage of the pressure imposed by the Turkish operations currently taking place inside Iraq to settle its accounts with the Kurdish opponents, as the Revolutionary Guards announced that it conducted extensive exercises near the Iraqi border.

Last week, Iran bombed two border villages, in the north of Erbil Governorate, and the Iraqi Kurdish network “Rudaw” said that the Iranian bombing targeted the headquarters of two Kurdish units opposing the Iranian regime, namely, the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Revolutionary Kumala party of Kurdistan.

Last Saturday, a former Kurdish official, Sadegh Zarza, survived an assassination attempt in a Dutch city by an Iranian man. The Zarza family told The Eastern Herald that the Tehran regime was behind the operation.

A source in the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs told The Eastern Herald that Iraq does not look friendly to armed groups operating from its lands to target neighboring countries.

During the past years, Iran has repeatedly bombarded the sites of the two parties on the Iraq-Iran border, and has killed many of their supporters, and has launched sweeping arrest campaigns against anyone suspected of collaborating with them on its soil.

Mysterious bombings targeted the headquarters of the two parties in Iraqi Kurdistan, accusing Iran of being behind it.

Even before this, Iran used to resort to fierce solutions, usually without appearing willing to conduct a real dialogue with the Kurds on its soil, after “being drawn on the pretext of having a political dialogue.”

Qasimlu was the former head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party.

About 5 to 7 million Iranian Kurds live under conditions described as repressive, as they are prohibited from learning their native language. Iran executed and imprisoned dozens of civilian and political activists, and pursued them even outside Iraq.

The Kurdistan Free Life Party, “PJAK”, was founded in 2004, and it fought extreme conflicts with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, which intensified greatly in the years 2008-2011 before the party formally ended its military operations, but limited clashes are still taking place from time to time.

And “PJAK” is closely related to the PKK, and it is also a left-wing party with a strong-armed wing."

I think you're thinking too short term, it's not like the UK leaving and their contribution along with it will suddenly leave the EU in a major deficit, they'll have to balance that over time and rethink future projects but it's not an instant threat. (We're basically arguing the towards the same, that money will have to appear from somewhere, but have different views on how and when)

About that Brexit recession that didn't happen, not saying it definitely will, but Brexit it self in practice will only start by the end of this year, we're now in a transition period where almost nothing changed, might still be fine but I'm betting on the recession (surely they will blame it on covid instead, just like they already call success when Brexit itself is ongoing), I might of course be completely wrong, we'll see."
2020-06-23 23:10:25,mittro70_,"Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, who repeatedly parried questions on the casualties suffered by the People's Liberation Army since the incident occurred, reacted to the [remarks](https://www.rediff.com/news/report/china-lost-almost-40-soldiers-in-galwan-gen-vk-singh/20200621.htm) of former army chief and Minister for Roads and Transport Gen V K Singh (retired) who said, ""If we lost 20 soldiers, more than double the number were killed on their [Chinese] side.""

Asked for his reaction on Tuesday at the media briefing, Zhao said, ""China and India are resolving the issue on the ground through military and diplomatic channels.

""As for Indian media reports that cite Indian officials as saying at least 40 Chinese soldiers were killed, I can tell you responsibly that this is false information,"" he said, according to an official transcript released hours later.

This is the first time China has commented on the casualties. The spokesman, however did not elaborate.

Though China has not revealed its casualty figure, there were reports that a commanding officer of the Chinese army was among those killed in the clashes. There is no official confirmation about it.

Ever since the clash on June 15 at the Galwan Valley between the Indian and Chinese troops, Beijing has consistently declined to reveal the details of the casualties on its side, while the official media editorials have said that China too suffered casualties."

I hope so. Some of what emerges from US universities, particularly sociology departments, is not scientific and not held to a high standard. Maybe over time this will self correct, as you say.

&gt;What is truly interesting about it is that there have been researchers who studied the process itself to better understand it's flaws. They would look, for instance, at wether personal bias or private funding influences your results.

I would love to know more about this. I can just google it if you don't have anything handy, I hope there are decent reads not locked behind academic journal paywalls.

2020-06-23 22:16:02,stampingpixels,"Yeah, I get all of that, but you are making an 'Is it good value?' case. I'm not making a judgement on that at all. I'm asking where is the money going to come from. 

So:


&gt;**the single EU market increased the average incomes of Germans by over 1,000 Euros, above the EU average increase of 840 Euros**.

Great, but that cash doesn't flow into the EU It's value to the German people themselves (note- not everyone agrees with Bertelsmann's assessment of benefits and the way they arrive at the figures they quote). 

&gt;Also, the amount they contribute cannot be directly compared, Germany for example is also one of biggest countries in the EU, naturally they'll pay more.

Again, correct, but if the EU is 9.4bn short of their budget in 2021, that per capita contributions in Germany are quite reasonable doesn't help the EU when it's got fuck all in the bank account

&gt;The UK leaving will need to be counterbalanced, but it's not a simple net negative either since they will now have to pay increased tarifs to trade with the EU which they didn't before.

Possibly, but there's more to it than just 'how much of the 10bn can we make up in tariffs?' (and note- there's no guarantee that tarrifs will apply in the end). 

For a start, what if trade goes elsewhere? What if the trade the UK loses with EU it  makes up with India, the Americas, Canada and the Antipodes? Doing business with more distant countries doesn't cost any more (gravity model of trade we know no longer applies- it's why the UK Treasury's predictions of a post Brexit vote recession didn't materialise), so why should the UK trade with a bloc that applies tariffs?

Also, tarrifs are reciprocal- and the UK buys more from the EU than vice versa. A tariff - heavy deal may well eat into those net benefits Bertelsmann claims for german families more than it affects the UK. 


&gt;And while it's easy to talk about benefactors and contributors, the goal is to develop the benefactors so in the long term they can better sustain themselves and pay their dues

And as I said, I've not found an example of this happening. I am probably wrong that it has never happened, but I definitely don't think Poland is all of a sudden going to be throwing billions into the pot to make up for the UK contributions. Even if this does happen, it's a long time away, and there's a hole to fill now."

2020-06-23 21:58:29,LogicalSquirrel,"Understood. I don't share your faith in the incorruptible nature of academia however . Some believe the system of peer review has broken down in American Universities. That the peer review process has become fundamentally flawed because of an abundance of academics who are ideologically possessed enough that they break it in the name of politics (both internal to academia and national/world), a greater good, etc. 

I hope that this is not the case elsewhere, in other Democratic nations. I realize how valuable universities are and I don't know what we would do if public trust in them were completely eroded. I also hope the problem of ideology impacting the quality of US education is overblown. I'll admit it could be.

2020-06-23 21:47:06,IotaCandle,"&gt;Propagandists are propagandists

Well researchers are not propagandists. If I were you I'd read up on the scientific method, because unlike the folks at Mises.org I'm not paid for my typing. 

In short Academia usually relies on the scientific method to find out how the world works. Researchers will gather data and design new methods to gather it, they will emit a hypothesis on the underlying causes behind their results and try to either design experiments or gather more, different data to get a better idea. 

The key to make it work is replication. The methodology for gathering the data, the data itself, the corrections that have been done to it and the conclusion are published so that other researchers may consult it. Peer review simply means a number of rather knowledgeable people read the paper to see if it was worth publishing. 

Other researchers who are familiar with the subject might express criticism of either the methodology, the corrections or the logic behind the conclusion. Everything is up for debate. Ultimately other tea ear chers might actually try to replicate the results of the study : using the same methodology as the previous team to see wether they get the same results. 

The point is that even if conservative professors were outnumbered 10-1 and liberals ran the game, any flaw in their work could be the subject to criticism, and good criticism of widely accepted research is a surefire way to boost your career. 

The system is intended to work despite the bias of researchers."

That statement directly contradicts nearly every peace of evidence ever made in the field of economics. Economics is absolutely not a zero sum game; and I can provide over a thousand examples for you. People realized economics wasn’t zero-sum hundreds of years ago, not sure why it’s talking you so long to figure it out. Economics is POSITIVE-SUM. 

If you buy a pound of strawberries, for example, for 3 dollars, you gain something you value more then the three dollars (food), and the seller gets something more valuable to him then the excess food (money). 

“Most economic fallacies derive from the tendency to assume that there is a fixed pie, that one party can gain only at the expense of another.”"

2020-06-23 21:01:10,xthorgoldx,"No, it's not the same move - it's actually an arm of financial, labor,  and travel law.

Think of it this way: let's say Japan only grants visas to 50,000 foreign teachers per year. This isn't a measure to ""keep foreign ideas out,"" but rather it's designed to prevent the local market from being flooded, *and* to prevent people from using fake pretenses to enter the country (""Oh yeah, I teach English for... one hour, a month, to my wife""). Now, let's imagine that there's a Generic Tutor Company that hires teachers; a bunch of spies get caught, and they're all employees of that company. Consider how the situation changes in different scenarios:

* The company *isn't* affiliated with the spies' government - they thought the spies were legitimate teachers, and were used as cover without their knowledge. All of the other teachers are innocent.
* The company *isn't* affiliated with the government, but it did work with them - they accepted a bribe or other deal to cover for the spies. *Most* of the other employees/teachers are innocent.
* The company was founded, from the getgo, as a front agency - it was never a real company, it's all just cover for the spies. If there are any real teachers, they're the exception.

""Foreign government agents"" are companies that fall into the second and third examples: companies that are either *direct* arms of a foreign government (i.e. not legitimate businesses) or that are far too cozy to be called separate. If Japan was to bar the GTC from sponsoring teacher visas in the *first* case, it would be unfair punishment of an innocent company - but in the second and third cases, it would make perfect sense. ""You're not hiring real teachers, so you can't sponsor teacher visas.""

This is basically the impact that foreign agent declaration has in the US. Organizations that are flagged as illegitimate are forfeited some of the privileges that real companies get, particularly when it comes to travel, financial accountability, legal interactions with US entities, etc. It's not even *close* to a First Amendment issue."
2020-06-23 21:00:37,LogicalSquirrel,"&gt;Literally two comments up you were wondering for what reasons people in academia were mostly democrats.

I don't see where I stated I was wondering this. Maybe I'm overlooking it? I did use the phrase ""for whatever reasons"", but my intent was that I thought the reasons didn't matter for the point I wanted to make.

&gt;You've got your answer. As part of their education they were trained in critical thinking and learned how to find and evaluate scientific research. Depending on their major they ended up with greater knowledge on how the world works. 

Sociology departments in the US often teach things based on social theories that involve very little scientific research.

&gt;Scientific research.

We are discussing universities, the source of most scientific research in the US and perhaps the rest of the world, overwhelming conforming to a particular ideology. They are supposed to find this interesting enough to investigate and report on? As if anyone at one of these institutions would have the balls to even try?

&gt;And there it is. Critical reading involves identifying what type of document you are reading, and who wrote it. Mises was an economist who argued that markets should rule the world and that governments should barely exist if at all. No regulations or age of consent laws. 

This is fair enough. I believed the liberal and increasingly far-left slant of academia was obvious, so I did a quick search for some supporting articles just to respond to you. Having said that, so few right wing staff in academia means that any source that has taken the time to do their homework on this topic will likely come from a right wing think tank. I don't see the difference in value in publicly versus privately funded propaganda. Propagandists are propagandists. The only alternative would be garbage right wing opinion pieces.

&gt;Ironically the reason you know academia leans liberal is because academics took the time to collect, compile and publish that data in peer reviewed journals. It's not as if it was a secret.

Can you provide some sources? I'm genuinely interested in this topic and if you have something better than I found I would love to read it. Thanks."

Even if the procedure didn't have the all of the usual risks of such surgeries (especially in young children, and those risks are highly elevated - medical interventions in early life should be avoided whenever possible), it would still be a basic violation of human rights.

It's medically unnecessary, and often harmful - there is no good reason for such procedures unless they are specifically requested by the patient themself - under informed consent.

The procedures which are involved are not harmed by delay - if the patient expresses interest, then they can (and should) be made available - but I can ensure you that not every intersex person want such procedures - and no one other than them can decide that for them. 

It is unnecessary risk in every respect.

You should read about Christiane Voelling, who was clearly harmed by exactly what you are advocating for - and successfully sued in Germany.

What do you expect? Exclusively left wing sources saying they took the time to examine universities and discovered their ideology was potentially overrepresented? I don't know anything about mises.org. I assume it's a right wing think tank from your response?

&gt;Now yes, most teachers in the US are democrats. This is because democratic policies make sense, while conservative policies are basically kleptocratic. What passes as radical left wing policies in your country is a reality in most of the developed world

Many traditional Democratic policies focused on things like social safety nets can be effectively argued for, yes. There is a move away from simple economic policy into social realms that disregard traditional liberal values (such as free expression), currently occurring on the American left, however. Also, I'll never understand using ""we do it, so you should too"", though. As if the US and the rest of the world are identical. As if the rest of the world hasn't relied on the US for decades for defense, R&amp;D, etc. I understand the US is currently and idiotically forfeiting this position of leadership, but it is still worth mentioning.

&gt;Those policies work and provide benefits far outweighting their costs, yet if your only source of information was american media you'd think that free healthcare, freeing nonviolent drug offenders and not toppling foreign regimes every 3 years are radical positions. If you froze Biden and brought him over here in Europe with the same program he'd fall off the right side of the spectrum. 

I don't know who outside of boomers is relying on our media for information. It is corrupt and dishonest to the core, regardless of which ""side"" a particular outlet is on. I think most Americans want healthcare reform, we just disagree on how to do it. Most of us are sick of foreign wars, and we are increasingly sympathetic to drug and criminal justice reform.

&gt;Many conservatives keep wondering why the more educated people are, the more liberal they seem to be. The answer is in the question : they are more educated.

Conservatives are wondering that? If they are, I would tell them simply that indoctrination is a hell of a drug."

This bent seems to have recently (past 1-3 decades?) evolved from a traditional liberalism into something else entirely, something based on critical theory (power dynamics of groups, etc.). 

These individuals would like to see society reshaped to be more inclusive, fair, equal. Programs such as Gender Studies are absolutely their wheelhouse, and they send droves of students out into the world armed with this belief set. 

To be upfront, I'm American and I don't know how much this is occuring elsewhere in the world. In the interest of honesty, I'll also state the obvious: I don't agree with this ideology at all. I believe it's dangerous to liberalism, despite the good intentions of its' true believers.

You will have lecturers who handle it purely from the perspective of western feminism, some lecturers will handle it from the perspective of more general feminism and while others handle the subject across a significantly broader spectrum.

Mind you - not shitting on feminism here. It very much has a place and should be an integral part of gender studies, but not the sole focus. Hell a comparison of traditional western feminism and some conflicting points of non western feminism are super interesting. But once more should be a segment, not the sole focus.

There’s enough people that shit on feminism for largely focusing on female issues or looking at the world from a female lease, forgetting that the same thing as with BLM versus the people that run around screaming All lives matter applies as well.

One of the issues it probably suffers from is the plethora of different viewpoints of what GS should be about.

&gt;Gender Studies is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on the complex  interaction of gender with other identity markers such as race, ethnicity, sexuality, nation, and religion.

Then again it could be just false advertising, so I skimmed through a few colleges' study programmes and they do seem pretty broad, with subjects that cover anthropology, sociology, legislation, education, economics, criminology, health... and promoted career options are just as diverse, from social work teams to cultural industry agents to media channels to advertising."

&gt;&gt;would ban all educational institutions from “propagating theories and opinion on gender identity according to which gender is a separate concept from biological sex”.

&gt;They just don't like the idea of gender. Although you can argue for gender studies, this is pure censorship of basic ideas. It's directed in part to trans people. It's getting us back to medieval times.

Yeah, budget could be one of the reasons, but then why they hit gender studies specifically? Because they knew chuds like many other commenters here would have a field day applauding the fact that ideas they don't like got oppressed.

In biology, we had the theory that there were two sexes (in humans), and that every individual would fit into one of those two categories. This turned out to be false - so we dropped it. Science does not allow exceptions, not physics, not biology, and not sociology. 

But in your example of a foal with three legs, we can conclude correctly that not every foal will be born with four legs. Horses are still quadrupeds because that is not a strict categorization, but a broad description.

2020-06-23 15:48:46,Direwolf202,"That term is absolutely devaluing the affected people. Why? Firstly, because it is inaccurate - there are intersex people with no specific anatomical differences - but secondly, because it implies that there is something wrong with the people who do have such differences. That is up to them to decide, not us. 

(And a philosophical point: I do not have to hold that people suffering physical deformity are lesser, merely that they are devalued - devaluation is a social condition, not a moral one - and I can say that someone has been devalued while simultaneously believing that they should not be). 

And as you identify, intersex is probably a misnomer. Just as morning sickness can occur at any time of day, intersex people are not necessarily ""between sexes"", they are something else. To be intersex is to be something other than male or female - that is all that there is to it. 

There is no deciding if someone is ""one or the other"", that doesn't play into this. The relevant fact is that they aren't either of the categories. You can't shift reality to do that. Now, if you acknowledge gender as separate from sex, this becomes much easier - because then, you can have people who are actually intersex also be of a particular binary gender - which means that you don't have to put people with Kleinfelter's syndrome into the category of ""male sex"", you can instead say that they are intersex and with male gender - which is both more accurate, and many times more useful. 

One could describe that as the introduction of new sexes, but it is better to think of it simply as a failure of naive categorization - a recognition there no non-trivial categorization which can include everyone."

Irrelevant. If biology was physics, it'd be called physics. The laws of physics are supposed describe how things are factually. This means if we find out things are in a way that is incompatible with the theories we have, it means the theories don't describe reality adequately.\
Biology is similar on the small scale, but to observe traits in species, such as sex, doesn't have the same demand for absolute accuracy and allows exceptions.\

It's actually much more complicated than that. Individual genes may cross over between chromosomes during meiosis, resulting in XX males and XY females, or other variations. And that's just in humans, once you get into other species it becomes even more complex.

There are no such things as neat categories or clean lines in biology. Everything is inherently fuzzy. That's why there are a dozen different definitions of what a species is. Ultimately you just have to find a heuristic that is good enough for most cases and deal with the exceptions as they arise."

2020-06-23 14:59:59,Quantentheorie,"&gt; We're dealing with gender study particularly. 

Yes, but the grounds on which you want to support a ban or defunding must apply equally to all fields of study, so unless you're willing to do away with other studies that fit the criteria you proposed here, it's not a valid criteria. 

I personally have some doubts if gender studies has a strong claim to be it's own degree/major and if they want challenge it's scientific claims then that's something they should pursue. It's why homeopathy should not be a medical degree. But targetting genders studies because you single it out among many economic deadend is not that. 

&gt;  Also we're talking about on what a government can afford and should. A government is concerned with budget and voters. 

Yes we are, and that's why I'm *reminding* you that budget shortage is not an argument for authoritarian and discriminatory policy. Defunding universities because of a vague notion that they're not churning out enough people with degrees the goverment deems ""beneficial to society"" is an extremely controlling governmental move, especially without properly assuming the burden of proof for the claim.

&gt; If you have lots of money, you can even go to abroad to study if your government does not provide funding in your country to study these subjects.

2020-06-23 14:54:47,Troppin,"&gt; Turkey was not invading then

Because there were US troops as well as fortifications the Kurds built. Trump told them to take down the forts, because US troops were staying. They took them down, then Trump pulled out the troops.

That's when the Turkish army came in with their ISIS allies to slaughter Kurds.

As for Mattis's replacement, they had to promote someone in house, because there weren't many qualified people who wanted the job."
2020-06-23 14:54:20,Clashlad,"Yeah it’s called tax. And also consumption, which directly benefits the developing world. 

Also no you don’t need to give things up to help the poor. Economics is not a zero-sum game. One person being rich does not make another person poorer. 

You can give things up, such as some money etc, and this is certainly a good thing to do. But making poorer people richer doesn’t require rich people becoming poorer. That’s such a false understanding of economics."

2020-06-23 14:50:48,wierdnitro7,"Personally, this is what happens when a course is hyper-politicized: probably should be banned, but I don't blame them. For context, imagine if there was a class closely associated with Nazism or white supremacy? Not everyone attending that class is crazy, but some would be, and would be more likely to be radical and violent activists, like Antifa or sometimes BLM can be today. I don't think people are being super aggressive about gender acceptance right now, but more that it's closely related to modern far leftism, imo. We'll see, I kinda want to take a class to see for myself, if it's not too pricey."
2020-06-23 14:50:40,DCFY7439,"But, you are talking about December 2018. Turkey was not invading then. And Trump ultimately didn't follow through on that demand.

See, Mattis is deep state but he is not a swamp. He was a General. But Trump replaced him with the swampiest character there can be for Secretary of Defense position. 

I agree that Trump and Mattis had differences in opinion and they had personality conflict like Trump had with General Kelly. But it is not like Trump is replacing them with some unknown outsider who wouldn't tow the MIC/ Deep State/ Security state line. He is replacing them with literal deep state agents and swampy characters. That's why I don't understand how Trump is not simply doing what these swamps are telling him to do."

As for your comment, I think you're asking the true questions, and this last paragraph is one of the reasons why so many people look at gender studies so badly.

 I can swear that I see deconstructionist approach justified too many times as a valid scientific approach. It's somehow justifiable if you do literary theory but please, don't pretend to do social science if you consider literary theory as you're methodology because I would look down on you and crush your study no matter how high are your moral standards doing what you're doing.

That the top comment at this time is dismissive of the difference between gender and sex and ignores the good things that come out of gender studies in favour of an unsourced opinion on the validity of an entire field of study isn't your fault. It just speaks to the amount of people who are uncomfortable with the results of gender studies and brand themselves as sexist, homophobic, or transphobic. We have a lot of work to do."

Deputies and senators pointed out that the radical conductor exerted ""symbolic, political and media violence"" on Cristina Kirchner Source: Credit File: La Noche de Mirtha.  
Baby Etchecopar not only earned the rejection of Kirchnerism by calling Cristina Kirchner ""the cancer of Argentina"" during the Mirtha Legrand program.  He was also denounced by 65 legislators of the Frente de Todos, mostly women, for gender violence.
The presentation was made before the Public Defender of Audiovisual Communication Services, by Mirian Lewin.  The text indicates that Etchecopar's sayings imply forms of symbolic, political and media violence foreseen in the National Law of Integral Protection to Prevent, Punish and Eradicate Violence against Women, while violating the provisions of Law 26,522 on  Audiovisual Communication.
During the Mirtha Night program (Eltrece), Etchecopar said that while the former president ""dips in politics, there will be no national peace.""  In addition to defining her as ""the cancer of Argentina"", the radio host continued: ""She is a single woman who does not want anyone. She looks in front of the mirror and says' I am splendid to hit heads and I am going to ruin the life of the  people. It must be said. If Cristina continues in Argentina, Argentina ends. ""
The presentation of the official legislators, which indicates ""the assent"" of the rest of the diners ""to the phrase of Etchecopar, also calls on the Public Defender to"" train those responsible for the program in audiovisual production with a gender perspective  ""and"" remedial measures aimed at promoting and protecting the dignified and equal treatment of women in general, and specifically of women who work in the political sphere in the audiovisual media, are implemented.

Do you really think Presidents work morally ignoring the interest of MIC/SS/DS ? That's naïve. I agree they do what's best for their reelection but they don't do anything moral.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But with both the example of withdrawing troops from Germany and abandoning Syria to Turkey and Iran I just don't see how that would be in the interest of MID/SS/DS.  

It's clear if you follow the US security state's recent decisions, they just don't see Russia as the prime enemy anymore no matter how much democrats screech trying to tie Trump to Putin. They see China as the bigger threat and US is ramping up their operation in South China Sea. The big game is no more in the Western/ Eastern Europe. US is investing massively in modernizing nuclear weapon and NATO is expanding but the threat to global US hegemony doesn't come from Russia, it comes from China. 

And, when it comes to Syria, that decision made all the strategic sense. US figured out Syria is a lost case. Russia has it in control and US can't directly attack Iranian proxies and endanger all its troops all around the middle east. US has pulled out and gave Israel the full license to strike Syria from Lebanese airspace. Perfect strategy. And US never cared about the Kurds, they were just pawn for US geopolitical gain. US fed the same Kurds to Saddam in First Gulf War and helped Saddam to gas the Kurds in Iran Iraq war. The strategy US chose is to deprive Syrian regime from its oil fields and sanction them  (Caesar Act) to death to weaken Assad to the extent that he has no other option but to come to a political solution that favors US. Also to weaken him to an extent he can't be a threat along with Iran and Hezbollah to US's other allies. 

Honestly, these decisions make perfect sense to me. I would like to know how these decisions weakened US interest."

#The Rock and Ursula von der Leyen to co-host corona event
European Commission chief to co-host concert and summit featuring Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber.

He's starred alongside Rachel Weisz, Vin Diesel and a crocodile named Lizzie, but now Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson is preparing to share the limelight with ... Ursula von der Leyen.

The president of the European Commission will join the former wrestler turned action movie lead as co-hosts of a global coronavirus pledging summit and concert on Saturday.

[Details of the event](https://www.politico.eu/article/commission-global-citizen-and-celebs-launch-second-corona-response/) were first revealed late last month. The Commission [on Monday](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_1129) gave more information on those who will take part.

The goal is to raise donations from everyone — not just major countries and philanthropists — to help find diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines to fight coronavirus.

Von der Leyen and Johnson — whose box office hits include ""Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle"" and ""The Mummy Returns"" — will co-host the event, which will include performances by Christine and the Queens, Shakira, Coldplay, Usher, Jennifer Hudson, Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber.

The concert — which is part of the Global Goal: Unite For Our Future campaign launched by the Commission and the anti-poverty movement Global Citizen — will also feature appearances by Chris Rock, Hugh Jackman, Charlize Theron, Forest Whitaker, David Beckham and Salma Hayek.

It will be broadcast by a number of European TV channels and on social media.

In a statement, von der Leyen said: “Artists have the power to inspire change. They use their talents to serve great causes. On 27 June, at the ‘Global Goal: Unite for our Future' Summit and Concert, artists, scientists and world leaders will speak with one voice, in a true and rare moment of global unity. They will commit to helping the world end coronavirus, while leaving no one behind. The European Union is fully committed to ensuring fair access to an affordable vaccine, as soon as possible, for everyone that needs it. United, I know we can make the world a safer place.”"

Much like Turkey that perpetually sits on the fence between pro-European Kemalism and Islamic conservatism, such a nation will never join the EU.

2) Russia's minimum demand is a neutral Ukraine, and they have the capabilities to enforce it. That's what the Donbas conflict is all about. So either we need to push Russia out militarily, but I don't see the political will for a WWIII in Europe. Or we make a deal with Russia, but I don't see what we could offer that Russia deems more valuable than a neutral Ukraine.

3) Even in the case of a comprehensive EU-Russia deal, Ukraine's politcal and economic instability precludes an immediate EU accession. But there cannot possibly be an accession period of 10 to maybe even 30 years. We can't trust the Russians for that long, neither do the Russians trust us, and I don't see the Ukrainians trusting us for that long either, meaning the pro-European majority will probably crumble eventually before accession can be finalized. And what if they can't fix the economy and curb corruption within that timeframe? The only way out I see is immediate EU accession but complete EU oversight over Ukraine for a period of even up to a quarter century. An EU anti-corruption agency, EU-appointed judiciary, EU veto on Ukrainian laws etc. This would be a very hard pill for Ukraine to swallow, first giving up territory to Russia for the Russia deal and then giving up sovereignty to the EU for the EU deal, and I don't see the political will for something like that in Ukraine."

I asked a direct question, what exactly gender means, and the answer given was so vague and all-encomasing, that it heavily encroaches on other established sciences, like anthropology, psychology, sociology and philosophy. I am not judging, I am genuinely curious, what do gender studies study, that does not fall under an umbrella of previously listed sciences? Because to me it sounds like it can perfectly be a part of, say, sociology, or psychology, or like bionics, be a subscience on the fringes of those, but not an established science in it's own right.

Here is a simple example with scifi, You dont have a degree for light sabers because you dont even know how to make one, first you would need to know how to make one, it can be a ficticious item or you can actually make it, noone knows so right now we consider it is ficticious.

However, you can continue to study lazers, electronics, light and physics, etc and have a degree for those topics because we already know a lot about those. And inside those actual degrees, you can try to make a light saber and study what works and what does not work."

If gender is as simple as fashion trends and stereotypes within a certain culture, then that is certainly worthy of study, becuase in almost every culture that I'm aware of, it's much more complicated and important than that. 

And we do not know to what degree gender is genetic, that is a point worthy of study - we would want to know the degree to which it is genetic - and that is only one specific problem, and not really one that gender-studies is concerned with beyond the implications of its answer. We know a lot about gender in a lot of ways, but the fact that our knowledge of it is limited is precisely why we need to study it.

But with both the example of withdrawing troops from Germany and abandoning Syria to Turkey and Iran I just don't see how that would be in the interest of MID/SS/DS. Both decisions seems to be far more harmful to the US global interests in the long run than they are to the nations they are being targeted at or for the benefit short term US self-interest.

It is hard to beleive the it was in the interests of the deep state rather than Trump stubbornly thinking he knows best and withdrawing thousands of troops to back up some of his campaign trail rhetoric and please a subsection of his voter base."

Can you confirm that people only choose this study as an easy cop-out or because their parents will pay it in full? Why is it useless as opposed to other studies? Generally, I'm just curious where you get these ideas from.

I think a relatively new study field that highlights different ideas and schools of thought, previously not part of mainstream consciousness, can be difficult for the public to swallow at first. The vigor of its students can come off strong as well, because they see things through a new lense and want to share this with others, which can be in an unfortunately abrasive way. It makes people shut themselves off from others who try a more reasonable approach, resulting in them resorting to a more extreme approach

It's no grateful task to be a professor or student of such studies, trying to make people aware of what you see, asking for the attention it deserves, needing to resort to ways people find confrontational and finding the public closed off, only to see governments starting to role back gender equality policies.

So in an ironic twist, governments shutting it down makes it even more impertinent that these studies stay in place and have people doing research."

Gender studies is almost entirely politically motivated at this point and has almost nothing to do with actually studying people.

2020-06-23 12:28:20,pbjtime12,"“Sexologist John Money introduced the terminological distinction between biological sex and gender as a role in 1955. Before his work, it was uncommon to use the word gender to refer to anything but grammatical categories.[1][2]“ If gender then meant the societal roles somebody has, then somebody who has 50% masculine roles and 50% feminine roles could consider themself something other than male or female as they wouldn’t fit themselves with the male gender or the female gender as they are equally both and equally neither. 

However, it being a term created that recently to describe destinctions between roles in society, denying its ability to evolve as a term is foolish. But even if you deny the current definition(s) of gender, a term needs to exist to define masculine and feminine traits. That is why gender was picked up as that term. 

Claiming that it means whether you have a penis or vagina is completely wrong. It originally meant if a word was feminine or masculine."
2020-06-23 12:27:52,hyperbolicplain,"Both my examples were very strongly advised against by nearly every single one of his military advisors.

I was never arguing that allies matter to Trump, they obviously don't. But to say he has little influence on foreign policy when he can dramatically alter it with one unexpected and ill-advised tweet cannot be very reasuring to either his advisors, his officials or special interest lobbyists.

You are right though, if you can manipulate him predictably then you weild some real power, I just don't beleive anyone can manipulate him predictably and/or consistently. He is a loose cannon who thinks he is a king rather than an elected public servant, and all the checks and balances that are supposed to prevent this kind of thought becoming a reality are falling woefully short."
2020-06-23 12:27:05,Oblivion_Wonderlust,"&gt;	There is very little within gender studies that is based on credible scientific experiments, as opposed to surveys or opinion polls.

Surveys and polls are in fact valid and credible scientific experiments and fall under the category of natural and field experiments (as opposed to controlled experiments) and utilise multivariable analyses (rather than isolating a given variable as done in lab experiments) to make and test predictions. This is because it would be virtually impossible as well as excessively expensive to perform said experiments in a controlled environment.

For example, testing the effects dietary choices on heart health. A cardiologist could predict that certain foods are better for the heart than others but the only way to test that hypothesis would be to go around asking people with good and bad hearts about what they eat. You can’t just take a thousand babies and feed some of them a different diet for 80 years to see how many on that diet are still alive.

Gender studies, like all social sciences are concerned with how people affect the society they are in and how people are effected by the society in which they live, therefore, the best method of data collection for these sciences is going out and asking people what they think about a certain subject. This is very similar 

Hypotheses and theories made by social-sciences are both testable and repeatable and are employed in fields like Advertising, Marketing, and Human Resource Management. 

You could, if you wanted, go out and test the hypotheses made by gender-studies scholars and get the same results.

Just saying “this doesn’t feel like real science” does not in fact make it not a real science. Facts don’t care about your feelings."

My point is quite simply that male and female are not accurate descriptors for many intersex people, that's all that matters there. 

Clothing has not had nearly as much of a profound influence on culture as gender has done. Why? Because unlike fashion, which is mostly unimportant for many people. Gender makes its effects known for everyone, no matter who they are - social expectations are placed on everyone for their gender - who you are willing to date is most often determined by gender - and naturally, people are discriminated against because of their gender, on the scale of countries.

Syria issue is an interesting one. Obviously Erdogan influenced Trump. Kurds had no other way so they went in and made a deal with Assad. Ultimately, US foreign policy is driven by its own interest. US security state felt more utility in letting Erdogan to invade and deal with YPG while US soldiers can block Syrian access to oil fields. I just don't see Trump made that decision unilaterally. All the people who had his ear definitely advised him to do this and Lindsey Graham &amp; Marco Rubio don't have his ear when it comes to this type of decision.

Dude same.

Clothing has had a profound influence too. I don't see your point. Ancient tribes have intricate headdresses and such, to do with different traditions and beliefs, just like gender.

&gt; I've gone into this in another comment chain, and I'm not repeating it here, but ultimately, sex is way more complicated than that - those exceptions to the norm are actually quite common (relatively speaking), and they seriously matter. 

Sex is not, actually.

To be intersex (0.05 or 1.7 percent, depending on who you ask and whether you include chromosome differences that do not result in morphological differences) is to have these variations. I'd put it in the middle of those, given both the increase in research into it but also the political weight of the subject.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex

The US media don't need permission, unlike in China, so there is no ""allowed"". They do whatever the fuck they want. The US government just said Bolton's book had classified info in it and wasn't done with the vetting process, and the media gave 0 fucks and released excerpts from the book as fast as they could get them.

Most famously, the government tried to stop the Pentagon Papers in 1971 and failed. 

Classified information exists and laws against its publication exist, but when it comes to matters of public interest, the government has to meet a very high standard to block publication.

Trying to equate this with China, which fucking banned Animal Crossing because the whiny babies in the CCP got mad that HKers posted anti-CCP slogans from art made in the game, is laughable. The CCP dictates to its propaganda outlets what to say."

If you study political science, you may want to know if women within a certain group statistically vote differently or according to different criteria than men, and why, and additionally if there are additional factors defining that difference.

What I found kinda most interesting was always though the mix of how  perspectives shifted with suffrage or how cultures change their policing between gender expression.

Overall the big takeaway I remember was added perspective and that there really are at least 3 distinct aspects that much of society either views as one single item or at least considers there to be a default mode and often targets the non ddefault mode repressively and how laws sometimes have to go against  the standard views of a society to guarantee a basic level of protection.

IF the CCP knows it can keep pushing and get no pushback, THEN they will keep pushing in greater and greater ways until they force a war.

On the other hand, IF the world stands up and draws a clear line in the sand, THEN the CCP will back down because, as you say, they don't want to jeopardize their power.

But as long as they feel their power is in no danger - that is, as long as the world dithers as China takes greater and greater ""liberties"" - they will push more and more, because they can do so with no cost.

This, seemingly paradoxically, means that being nice to China and trying to deescalate actually increases the chance of a major war and death, not decreases it.  We saw the same thing in the lead up to WWII where appeasement bought a temporary ""peace"" at the cost of a far greater death toll in the long run.  Where if the nations had stood together BEFORE Germany basically took out several of the major players (such as France) with strategic headshots, Germany would have been forced to back down initially and/or the cost of their belligerence would have hit them much sooner, curtailing their ability to wage war and kill people over the longer term."

To put a silly example, if you go outside you'll find out it's custom for women to wear skirts, more so than for men. There is nothing about male biology that prevents us from wearing skirts, and in fact skirts are deemed as appropiate pieces of male clothing depending on the place, you need a completely different branch of knowledge separated from biology to study that phenomena.

2020-06-23 10:57:17,Direwolf202,"People: Gender studies is not what you think it is, and this ban is more than just gender-studies as you might see it in a US context. 

Firstly, Gender studies, the academic subject (which is definitely banned by this, not that it's a specific subject in most of Europe anyway) is the subdiscipline of sociology which studies historical and cultural approaches to gender. They have to take an inclusive view of what gender actually is in order to perform this study because other cultures have ideas of gender which are more complex than the usual ""Sex and gender are the same"" - for example, [Two-spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-spirit) people.

Secondly, this is a ban on the discussion of sex and gender as seperate. That's a problem, because this is the view that is taken in most of science. Becuase sex is actually *really* hard to biologically define, and pretty much every rule that you can think of is broken by some exception somewhere. A hell of a lot of people are intersex and will never realise it, and will live their entire lives as a binary gendered person (which is fine, they aren't wrong about their gender, just unaware of their sex) - but it would be relevant for certain medical situations."

2020-06-23 10:52:13,jnkangel,"Gender studies is a fairly complex field that mixes sociology, anthropology, psychology, history even and a bunch of others.

It's less about gender and sex are two things, but more about how gender and sex impact people, how countries handle these impacts.

Overall it's generally easiest to see it like aspects of sociology and psychology and the majority of people that have it as a non-facultative course will likely end up with similar skillsets."
2020-06-23 10:52:07,Direwolf202,The study of historical and cultural approaches towards gender throughout history. It's a very narrow subdiscipline of sociology - but valid regardless.

Take, for example, myself. Male doesn't fit for me. Neither does female - I'm not comfortable calling myself either of those thigns, because I am not either of those things. My biology, I'm pretty certain, is male, but that doens't mean much in that regard. 

That said, gender studies is not really the study of gender itself, but is a very narrow subfield of sociology which studies societal and cultural approaches to gender throughout history and the world - they kind of have to take the approach that gender and sex are not the same, because many cultures included more complex ideas of gender (for a not-so-simple example, the [Two-Spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-spirit) people)"

1. Foreign governments aren't protected by the US Constitution. The CCP doesn't have the right to say anything at all in the US.

2. The US isn't silencing any Chinese state owned media. Instead, it is just correctly treating them as foreign agents and requiring the CCP to identify them as such.

3. Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, any person who acts on behalf of a foreign government to influence government officials or the American public “with reference to the political or public interests, policies, or relations” of the foreign government is required to register as a foreign agent with the U.S. DOJ. Additionally, section 614 of FARA has requirements for “filing and labeling of political propaganda.” FARA requires that any “informational materials” that a foreign agent distributes must be labeled with a “conspicuous statement” that the materials are being disseminated on behalf of that foreign government. It also requires that such “propaganda” be filed with the U.S. Attorney General."

- The Earth is not flat. This is not up for debate.
- Unless new, peer reviewed evidence comes out, there are only two sexes, and by proxy, only two genders.
- Unless new, peer reviewed evidence comes out, sex and gender are identical for everyone except those suffering from a dysmorphia-related mental disorder.
- Gender dysmorphia is, as of right now, determined by scientific consensus to be a real disorder defined (loosely) as the disagreement between mental gender and biological sex. Common alleviation of symptoms takes the form of various ""transition"" operations and therapies, including but not limited to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and gender reassignment surgeries (GRS) - the latter of which does not only mean genitalia-related operations.
- Theology exists, regardless of your personal opinions or beliefs. One can be secular and still study how other cultures, both presently and historically, have subscribed to different forms of theology. It is very much an academic study.
- Likewise, one can, academically, study gender throughout culture, both presently and historically, without subscribing to some of the more outlandishand unscientific far-left beliefs about gender."

2020-06-23 09:04:46,Schicken_Soup,"It basically boils down to form of body/soul dualism. Sex representing the Body, gender the soul. While interacting in a society people assume certain truth about you based on your body. If you are male, the colour associated with you is blue (funnily,  historically blue was the female colour) while a female gets associated with pink (which historically was the male colour). There are direct implications society holds dependant on your sex. Genderstudies deconstruct these, basically saying, you have a body? Good for you. Doesn't mean you know shit about me. Gender becomes the expression of your self, influenced by your own desires and societal expactstions, thus you only express and perform a certain aspect of your self.
If you take all stereotypical ideas of males and females you derive at the ideas of proto-forms, which generate a continuum. Once you divert from the proto form, you are on the spectrum between male and female.

So basically gender studies says: don't assume you know me, or my desires based on whether I have Penis or a Vagina. I can be great with kids, I can be great at math, but my body won't tell you which is true.

This ofc goes against the teachings of all that bronze age literature, which so many still hold so dear and threatens their own perception and role in society and life, thus frightening them.

It's an intermediate between anthropology, philosophy, psychology and sociology attempting to understand humanity as a collective of individuals, each with their own desires, hopes and wishes. So, unless your position is, we are all cookie cutter enteties, you already made the first step into gender studies."

2020-06-23 08:59:31,DCFY7439,"President Aleksandar Vucic’s nearly complete control over the Serbian state was bolstered on Sunday after his party won a landslide victory in parliamentary elections boycotted by most of the opposition in protest at his autocratic policies.

Mr. Vucic was not personally up for re-election, but his political coalition, the nationalist Serbian Progressive Party, was projected to win more than 60 percent of seats in Parliament, according to initial results.

This puts the party on the threshold of a “supermajority,” which, if secured, would allow its lawmakers to change the constitution without the support of any other political faction.

The result could also give Mr. Vucic greater leeway to forge a peace agreement with Kosovo, the former Serbian province that broke from Belgrade in 1999, helped by an American-led bombing campaign, but whose sovereignty Serbia has never officially recognized.

The vote cemented Serbia’s move, under Mr. Vucic, away from a pluralist political culture. Since Mr. Vucic won the presidency in 2017, the quality of Serbian democracy has fallen from “free” to only “partly free,” according to Freedom House, an independent Washington-based rights research group that makes an annual assessment of each country’s political freedoms.

Rights observers regularly express concern over the influence Mr. Vucic wields over the judiciary, the electoral process, and both state and private media.

A former minister under Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian leader during the Kosovo War, Mr. Vucic said Sunday’s results were “absolutely incredible.”

“I’ve been in politics for a long time,” he said in a news conference after polls closed. “But I’ve never experienced anything like this.”

Election monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, an intergovernmental body funded by 57 mainly European member states, said that the election had been administered efficiently but that the “dominance of the ruling party, including in the media, was of concern.”

Tthe main opposition parties called the election illegitimate, noting that initial projections suggested that turnout was one of the lowest in Serbia this century. With most votes counted, the electoral authority said just over 50 percent of voters took part, while other monitors said less than half participated.
At a news conference on Sunday night, opposition leaders argued that turnout would have been even lower if Mr. Vucic’s party hadn’t intimidated thousands of people to vote in the final hours of polling on Sunday, or if the Serbian public broadcaster had run a more balanced program during the campaign.

At a news conference on Sunday night, opposition leaders argued that turnout would have been even lower if Mr. Vucic’s party hadn’t intimidated thousands of people to vote in the final hours of polling on Sunday, or if the Serbian public broadcaster had run a more balanced program during the campaign.

“Serbia unequivocally said ‘no’ to Aleksandar Vucic,” said Dragan Djilas, the leader of an alliance of seven opposition parties that boycotted the ballot, and encouraged their supporters to abstain from voting.

While the results give Mr. Vucic yet more power at home, analysts said they also put him under greater pressure internationally — because foreign leaders may now expect him to wield that power in their favor.

In recent years, Mr. Vucic has successfully curried support from competing global powers — maintaining a strong relationship with Russia and strengthening ties with China, while still positioning Serbia as a potential member of the European Union, and an interlocutor for the United States.

Mr. Vucic has said he has no intention of choosing between rival global powers and has, for the most part, successfully managed to navigate between outside interests.

But with the election passed and won, he faces immediate international pressure — particularly over the issue of Kosovo.

On Monday, he met with a senior envoy from the European Union, Miroslav Lajcak, to discuss a European-led initiative to forge a settlement with Kosovo.

On Saturday, he will meet at the White House with President Trump and his Balkan envoy, Richard Grenell, to discuss a rival, American-led initiative for a Serbia-Kosovo peace deal.

And in between, Mr. Vucic will fly to Moscow to meet President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who has historically said that any deal with Kosovo must have the approval of the United Nations Security Council, where Russia occupies a permanent seat.

“What he does next is going to be very interesting,” said Marko Savkovic, program director for the Belgrade Security Forum, an annual politics conference in Serbia. “It’s going to be very hard for him to keep doing what he’s been doing for the last couple of years.”

Mr. Savkovic added: “He’s going to be asked by more and more people: Are you going to take this country, that you’re now fully in control of, closer to the West? Or are you going to be just another Balkan autocrat?”

On Monday evening, Mr. Vucic continued to defy expectations about his foreign policy.

Having previously signaled his readiness to negotiate with Kosovo in a process led by Mr. Grenell and the Trump administration, Mr. Vucic told reporters on Monday that he would now prefer to work within the framework of an EU-led process.

“While I appreciate the efforts of Richard Grenell to find economic solutions between us and Pristina,” Mr. Vucic said, “we are completely committed to the EU-led political dialogue.”"

which sounds very much like negation of very existence of transgender people.

Funnily enough, quoted law itself is ambiguous. What is ""biological sex""? Genitals? Hermaphroditism exists. Chromosomal composition? Then what about people born with genitals opposite those they were supposed to have according to chromosomes? Brain structure? Classical nature versus nurture problem.

Interaction between cultural expectations on sex and gender and person's own identity isn't clear or that well understood and warrants proper research.

i challenge vice to investigate how 200 complaints with identical wording got registered across india against arnab goswami for the simple act of calling Sonia Gandi as Antonia Maino (which is her real name), and how he got attacked by goons at night near his house.  And how police is not investigating this at all.  I can bet that they will never do that, because it exposes the violence of the liberal/muslim/left... which is real."

2020-06-23 04:21:20,RectangleU,"Bruh, you used to word ""subjugated"" and then said for hundred years, which is straight up wrong. Thanks for the history lesson though. 

From Stearns, Peter N. (2000). The Spread Of Chinese Civilization To Japan:

&gt;In comparison to Korea, Japan controlled its intake of cultural influence from China, also known as 'cultural borrowing'. This meant that it ""acknowledged the cultural superiority of the Chinese Middle Kingdom"", while always holding onto its political independence.[3] In addition to controlling the process of 'cultural borrowing', Japan also remained selective when considering which Chinese ideas and institutions they wanted to adopt.

Edit: You can also read this [nice resume](http://www.historyhaven.com/APWH/unit2/Sinification_of_East_and_Southeast_Asia.htm) of the differences between  how Korea, Vietnam and Japan were influenced by China. But again it makes the same point clear: 

&gt;Of these three areas Japan was unique in that it consciously and intentionally chose to emulate Chinese civilization.  Japan was never conquered by the Chinese, but the success of China under the Tang dynasties motivated Japanese emperors to important elements of Chinese civilization for their own gain. 

----
&gt;The island was the only area around China to intentionally implement aspects of Chinese civilization.  Chinese script, bureaucracy, equal field system were all purposely borrowed.  Buddhism made its way into Japan as well.  The concept of a centralized imperial government, although weakened during this period, would re-emerge later in Japanese history. 

In regards to the Mongol invasion attempts, that Japan was mainly saved by the bad weather is a bit of an urban legend, they repelled the Mongols largely  by themselves and typhoons only played a secondary role. [You can read about it in depth from this /r/AskHistorians  thread with all the sources.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1k5af7/how_did_the_mongols_view_japan_after_the_battle/)"

2020-06-23 03:51:19,GreatRolmops,"Japan paid tribute to the Chinese emperors intermittently until the time of the Tokugawa Shogunate. Japan was considered a Chinese subject until 894 which is when the Japanese rulers stopped sending tribute. During this period China exercised a massive influence on all aspects of Japanese society (everything from politics to religion to culture and language). 

The Ashikaga shoguns revived the tributary relationship with China in 1401, although by this time Japan was no longer considered (by the Japanese) as a part of China but a sovereign country in its own right. This is reflected in the way the Japanese referred to their own country as ""China"" (Huaxia), using the same terms as the Chinese to describe their country. Although Toyotomo Hideyoshi did posit Japan as being part of ""Tianxia"" (which literally translates to ""all under heaven"" but actually meant just the Chinese Empire and its vassals, i.e. the sinosphere because the rest of the world apparently wasn't important to the Chinese) thus positing Japan as a part of China again. Although in this case Toyotomo probably did so only as part of his ambition to conquer Ming China and sit on the dragon throne. Either way, the tributary relationship was ended again by the Tokugawa shoguns, who also started to encourage isolationism and native Japanese culture over adopting Chinese culture.

Also, most Chinese dynasties actually maintained powerful navies, it was just that the Chinese emperors were generally not interested in expansion and conquest (since their realm was already so large and they had pretty much everything) and so those navies were mostly just used for protecting China's long coastline from pirates. The Mongol Yuan dynasty was an exception (at least in its early days), and they attempted to invade Japan twice, but both times their fleets had really bad luck with the weather, which saved Japan from being subjugated by the Mongols."

But all that turned out to be bullshit anyways because surprise surprise, in 2018 the UN found traces of uranium at a site that Iran had not disclosed on the JCPOA and Iran maintains is a laundromat.

2020-06-23 03:14:03,GreatRolmops,"Yeah, I am sure that is what Hitler and Napoleon thought. Just go in, decisively defeat the Russian army and get out again before you get bogged down in that massive landmass. Problem is, the Russians can just retreat and regroup forever and you can't just sit in an occupied city and wait. Armies require supplies to function. Lots and lots and lots of supplies in fact. Those supplies need to be able to get to your soldiers. This means that your supply lines are a vulnerable point in your army and need to be protected. In order to protect your supply lines, you need to occupy and control the surrounding countryside. In order to control the countryside, you need lots and lots of soldiers (who in turn, require more supplies). And the problem with massive countries like Russia is that they can always retreat, so to destroy their army and defeat them you need to advance deeper into their territory. And the farther you advance, the longer and more vulnerable your supply lines become. Eventually, your supply lines get so long that your forces become overstretched and you no longer have enough soldiers to guard and control everything. At that point, supply lines start being interrupted and cut off, which affects the combat effectiveness of your troops. If you advance even further past that point, you will no longer be able to guard your rear and the enemy will start to reorganize behind your lines, leaving your forces surrounded on all sides and disrupting the flow of supplies ever further. At that point, your defeat is guaranteed.

Not to mention that this also means that your the whole invasion is pretty much in vain. How can you win against an enemy that can just retreat forever, and as soon as your troops advance and leave an area, the returns there? What use is occupying a city if you can't control the surrounding countryside? You are basically just letting yourself get besieged, and everything of value will have been taken away by the retreating defenders. Against such an opponent it is virtually impossible to accomplish the typical objectives of an invasion.

And that is why the first rule on the first page of the Book of War is ""Do not march on Moscow"", and the second rule is to never get engaged in a land war in Asia. These landmasses are just too vast for anyone to successfully invade (unless you are a nomadic people like the Mongols and don't need supply lines).

And modern technology doesn't change anything about that. Modern soldiers still need to eat. Modern vehicles still need fuel. Modern weapons still need ammunition. And unless you have the ability to magically conjure up a million cargo planes and airfields everywhere, most of that will still need to be transported the old-fashioned way across land."

2020-06-23 02:56:36,GreatRolmops,"But that wasn't fought on Russian soil, so the meme holds true. :p Also, Germany only won against Russia because they sent Lenin (who was in exile in Switzerland) to make the Russian government collapse and cause a civil war. They supported the Bolsheviks because they knew the Bolsheviks were anti-war and would seek peace with Germany on favorable (for Germany) terms.

Also, Germany at the time was much larger and had a much stronger military while Russia was a backwards feudal state in the grips of revolution and civil war. All in all it is a very different situation from the present day."

2020-06-23 02:48:58,GreatRolmops,"You are really overestimating the German military.

1. Most of Germany's military equipment is quite old, and not as cutting-edge as the latest stuff that the US and Russia churn out. Germany still has a strong military-industrial complex (especially as they often work together with France, Italy and the Netherlands), but it isn't anywhere near close to the size and power of the military-industrial complexes in the US and Russia. Those countries have much faster development cycles than Germany.
2. Germany's military is actually really small. The army's combat units consist of just two mechanized divisions (of which the 1st is partially made up of Dutch soldiers) of 18,000 and 12,000 men respectively and an airborne division of about 12,000 men (also partially made up of Dutch soldiers). Contrast this with the forces of Russia's Western Military District: It has 3 field armies each of which is larger in size than Germany's entire army. The 1st Guards Tank Army alone has 4 times the amount of tanks that Germany has. Russia has hundreds of thousands of troops massed on the borders of Europe. And that is without the troops it could pull in from other Military Districts or the fact that Russia can mobilize over a million men as reservists with older equipment. The Russian military (like that of the US and China) just operates on an entirely different order of magnitude from Germany.
3. Germany is a world leader in its role as de-facto leader of the EU. The EU is an economic powerhouse, the largest economy in the world. Germany itself is the 4th economy of the world. But Germany's military power lags far behind its economic power, and if you know anything about Germany or about Germany's history you know why this is and that is unlikely to change anytime soon. Within the EU, France has a much more powerful military than Germany does. And Russia on the other hand is pretty much the exact opposite of Germany. It is only the 11th economy of the world, but its massive military power and willingness to use it allows Russia to punch far above its economic weight in the world league. This was true for the Soviet Union in the Cold War as well. The Soviet Union had an even worse economy than Russia has now, but having the world's most powerful military still allowed it to dominate world politics alongside the US.
4. Related to the above, Germany, unlike Russia, is very hesitant to use its military. This also means that the German military has very little in the way of actual combat experience, which the Russian military does have. Also, the Russian military practices a lot more than the German military does. Their exercises are both far more frequent and much larger in scale than those of Germany.
5. Crucial elements of modern warfare are tanks (and other armored vehicles), artillery, missiles and aircraft. Russia's air force is small compared to that of the US, but it is still the second-most powerful air force in the entire world. Russia has over 4 times as many aircraft as Germany. Its stockpile of munitions is also much, much larger. And when it comes to air defense systems, both in numbers and technology Russia is second to none and light years ahead of Germany. Missiles aren't a contest either. Russia has led the world in missile technology since the 1950's, and they have both more and more advanced missiles than any other country. Not to mention that unlike Germany, Russia has access to nuclear warheads (the largest nuclear arsenal in the world in fact). And the same is true for traditional artillery and tanks. Russia has more artillery pieces and armored vehicles than the rest of Europe combined.

Overall, the idea that Germany could just take on Russia is just as laughable as the idea that Germany could take on the US or China. Russia is a military world power, it just plays in an entirely different league than Germany does. You'd need a coalition consisting of pretty much every country in Europe just to have a hope of taking on Russia (and that is not going to happen, and even if it does a coalition like that would have some pretty massive disadvantages compared to Russia's united military)."

2020-06-23 02:36:59,PerunVult,"Most of NK artillery is stationary, contrary to South Korean artillery being mostly Self Propelled. Staple of Artillery tactics is so called ""Counter Battery fire"", where ballistic radars detect locations of enemy artillery and own artillery fires at those locations to silence enemy artillery. To counter this, SPG-s employ ""shoot and scoot"", immediately moving away to random location after firing, and only then deploying and reloading to fire again. Fixed or towed artillery can not move fast enough to escape CB fire. As such, NK, artillery aimed at population centres would be quickly silenced by SK artillery. Not quickly enough to prevent all damage, but I think threat they pose is overstated."

Russian reserves of military materiel are seemingly bottomless. Sure, most of that is mothballed Soviet-era equipment, hopelessly obsolete by today's standards, but to quote saying often attributed to Stalin: ""Quantity has quality of it's own"". All in all I don't think Russia could win against coordinated European response, but I would NOT expect that to be quick or easy fight.

At the same time, what really worries me in your posts, is that model you are expecting has all the markings of World War. Two large blocs, spread out over most of the world. Multiple theatres. And most importantly, network of tensions, alliances, allegiances, and influences that could easily result in chain reaction.

I don't know how but both of you are wrong, the only time Japan was subjugated by a foreign power was in the post WW2 years during the US occupation and Japan only invaded China one time in the Sino-Japanese wars of the early 20th century. Aside cultural imports by Japan when the nation was forming both countries for most of their history have had actually very little direct contact.

2020-06-23 00:29:29,GreatRolmops,"In what kind of alternate world would Europe smash Russia?

Russian forces outnumber EU forces in Eastern Europe by about 100 to 1. In addition, Russia's military is a lot better equipped with heavy weapons and armored vehicles (European militaries are mostly light infantry). Furthermore, Russia maintains a higher readiness level than most European countries. Russia can mobilize its forces with astonishing speed (as showcased in snap exercises) whereas European countries often need days or even weeks to mobilize comparable forces for exercises. In addition, Europe is not united, European militaries are all under different political and military leadership, speak different languages, use different equipment and in general lack a unified command and supply structure. Russia doesn't suffer from this, which means they can act more quickly, more decisively and can devote a greater proportion of their military to actual combat troops rather than supply and command. European militaries have a lot of redundant capacity because they all have their own command and supply structures.

Russia would overrun the Baltic States in a matter of hours, and by the time France and Germany have finally mobilized their forces they'd be facing a well-prepared and dug-in defender. And that is assuming that Western Europe even has the will and morale in order to go to war against Russia for the Baltic States. To revive an old cliché, most people here in the West definitely aren't prepared to go die for Danzig. Especially not against Russia which isn't really seen as an enemy by many in Western Europe.

And I am saying this as a European. Here in Europe we all know that we wouldn't really be a match for Russia, and that the US and NATO are absolutely critical to Europe's defenses. The small, unreliable, disjointed and unprepared forces of Europe aren't what is keeping Russia out of the Baltics, the deterrent of possible US retaliation is. Take away the US presence in Europe and Eastern Europe is toast. That is something that can't be stressed enough, and it is also why Eastern European countries are so keen on keeping and reinforcing the US presence in their countries. They can't rely on Western Europe, because even if Western Europeans somehow do find the will to go to war against Russia, they don't have the military power and preparedness to actually be of much help. Western Europe meanwhile is more than content to let the US take the responsibility of Eastern Europe because to be perfectly honest most Western Europeans couldn't care less about the Baltics or Eastern Europe (hell, there is plenty of people here who'd be glad to be rid of the East, as they are often seen as being a drain on the resources and prosperity of Western European countries)."

2020-06-23 00:16:19,GreatRolmops,"I wouldn't call it an idea world. Regardless of the outcome, a war between the US and China would cost millions, perhaps even billions of lives. And if China's friends decide to get involved it gets even more messy and we basically have WW3 and quite possibly the end of the world given the amount of nuclear weapons on both sides.

A war between the US and China would be the most devastating war the world has ever seen. US forces would be entirely occupied with that war, and likely unable to send reinforcements to Europe or South Korea if they get attacked. Russia and North Korea would know this, and likely seize the opportunity to achieve their strategic long-term goals in one fell swoop.

Russia has a close military partnership with China. They may send their Far Eastern forces to aid China or attack Alaska as a diversion, while their main forces would attack Europe. Russia has one of the largest and most modern land forces in the world. Without significant US support, Ukraine and the Baltic States would probably be gone in a matter of days. Depending on how successful Russia will be in destroying the much smaller EU forces, they may actually decide to press on into Poland and occupy it for the umpteenth time.

North Korea would probably see the absence of the US as the ultimate opportunity to achieve Korean unification. They'd invade South Korea and destroy Seoul with their prepared artillery. South Korea's army is much more modern than North Korea's, but North Korea's army is just massive. It is difficult to say how that war will go, given how little is known about North Korea. But either way, that war would likely cost millions of civilian casualties from the destruction of Seoul alone.

Iran will probably stay put though. Iran and Saudi Arabia are fierce rivals and pretty evenly matched. They'd probably keep each other in check."

I've heard that most of their artillery assert are old and out of date, with little to no maintenance. So if they were to use them a 30% would be fail or would shoot duds. 

It would still cause devastating damage but I think it's overblown how effective the North Korean arsenal would be in such a situation."
2020-06-23 00:09:13,Squirrelsquirrelnuts,"There are oil fields nearby that can be potentially affected by the ownership of the island. 

Japan annexed the disputed islands in 1895 (in the middle of the First Sino-Japanese War) by claiming they were *terra nullius* (ownerless land). It was a shaky claim at best because the notion of “discovering” some islands in one of the world’s busiest maritime regions was outright mental. However China did not contest it at the time since later in the same year the war ended with China ceding Taiwan to Japan. These islands are off the northeastern coast of Taiwan so it wasn’t really possible for the Qing dynasty or the ROC government to advance their claims in any way if they did claim it. 

Fast forward to the 1970s. Off shore oil deposits were discovered in East China Sea and Taiwan began to question Japan’s sovereignty. They argued that these islands were known to and used by Chinese fishermen in previous centuries and thus the Japanese annexation was invalid. China initially did not support Taiwan’s claims, as in the 1970s China and Japan were working very hard to improve their bilateral relations and Taiwan was still China’s ideological enemy No. 1. Later when Chinese-Taiwan relations also began to improve, China jumped on the Taiwanese wagon and began to show these islands as part of (the Chinese province of) Taiwan on its maps. 

At the moment there are some unwritten consensus between China and Japan regarding the oil and gas deposits in East China Sea. China stayed on its side of the Japanese claim, which is the middle line between the Okinawa islands and the Chinese coast, even though China claims that the divide should be the Okinawa Trench instead. If the status of these islands changes in the future it will alter the boundaries of both China and Japan’s claims in East China Sea. 

There are lots actors in this problem and redditors who are not familiar with the issue often fail to grasp how complex it is. 

For example in the mid 2000s China finished the construction of an oil and gas field right next to the middle line which outraged the Japanese government. But China was able to pull that off mostly because South Korea was heavily investing in that oil field and Hyundai actually did most of the actual construction works as a “fuck you” to Japan. 

Hong Kong citizens are also heavily involved in the dispute because neither the British nor the current Chinese HK governments has any incentive to rein in “sovereignty activists.” China and Taiwan don’t want to see their citizens go plant flags on these islands and cause diplomatic issues for no tangible gain. HKers don’t have this problem so most of the people who went there to plant Chinese and Taiwanese flags are actually from Hong Kong. The island dispute is one of the last few issues that pro-democracy and pro-establishment HK politicians still actually agree on. The “Protect Diaoyu” Association of Hong Kong has a fairly even distribution of pro-democracy and pro-establishment politicians in its leadership and past “sovereignty cruises” were usually manned by people from both sides."

2020-06-22 23:58:41,GreatRolmops,"&gt; Japan has smacked China several times before in history.  

And Japan was subjugated to China for hundreds of years as well. But the situation is now very different from what it was in the late 19th and early 20th century. China is no longer in a state of constant turmoil and civil war, it has modernized and has become the second economy and military power in the world. Meanwhile, Japan, while still a significant economic power, is small compared to China and its military is only a dim shade of what it was before WW2. Most importantly, Japan has no capabilities whatsoever to deploy its military beyond Japan itself. This means that Japan isn't a threat to China in any way. Even if Japan's military would be 10 times the size it is now, it would be useless if it can't leave its island.

India on the other hand may be a dirt-poor third-world country, but it is a very large third-world country with a very large and relatively modern military thanks to its close ties to Russia and the Western world. And unlike Japan, it has nuclear weapons. Even though India could not hope to stand up to China in a full military or economical confrontation, India's forces could still do significant damage to Chinese forces in the local area. This makes India a greater threat to China than Japan.

Ultimately though, China doesn't want war with anyone. It is just not in their interest to sacrifice many lives and risk their international reputation just to take some largely useless rocks in the Himalayas or the East China Sea."

Let me guess: ""I'm old so that justifies the fact I am uneducated about social issues and even if I do not covertly act racist I still inherently support the institution of white supremacy by literally being an ignorant fuck.""

Also, you know nothing about my age, so that makes the fact that you try to use it as a strawman and an ad hominem even more ridiculous. You're not only trying to disqualify my point of view based on WHAT YOU THINK is who I am, and not the ACTUAL substance of my viewpoint, but you're also literally taking a shot in the dark and guessing my age based on NOTHING and then PROCEEDING to try to disqualify my argument based on that.

I could be 57 far as you know. Just because I'm not racist like most other old white fucks doesn't 1. mean I'm young 2. inherently disqualify my viewpoint as though if I were actually young it would mean ANYTHING.

You wanna debate me? Attack my argument/viewpoint, not my person. My viewpoint is that you have the viewpoint of an alt-right fuckhead. If I am incorrect then go ahead and correct me but I've already read your shitshow of a comment history and that's enough for me to see what a huge ignorant dickhead you are."

And don't go around making false equivalences between all sorts of camps, the internment camps for Japanese in ww2 usa where different from the pow camps of the allied which where different from the gulags which where different from the Nazi death camps, which where different from these Chinese ""reeducation camps"".

But more importantly: fighting that war was almost at the balanced tipping point to fight the war. The genocide was millions and the sacrifice to stop it was millions. 

Right now a WWIII trade off is save millions at the cost of hundreds of millions, possibly even break a billion. 

It’s hard to fathom how much of a nightmare a true war in this age would cost in terms of lives.

This approach has repeatedly shown to be an absolute shit one over the last couple decades, and I do not support repeating it yet again.

The way that has the best odds of succeeding without millions of deaths is slowly allowing North Korea to open, mainly to south korea to begin with, while having them give concessions, albeit less extreme ones than giving up their primary means of defense. North Korea has been open to this. Getting rid of the nukes will have to be a long term goal, opening with it is simply impossible. Does this mean we should immediately ease all sanctions and start selling weapons to North Korea? No, of course not. They're generally not demanding that either. But one step at a time.

I think at this point, after comparing me to a nazi and then apologist of China’s actions, I must make it clear that I’m neither both. I despise the actions of China, but still, I can’t see a good enough justification for a war. Imagine what would be the consequences of an American invasion over a territory that holds about 19% of the entire world’s population. As I said: “IT ONLY SHOULD BE TAKEN AS LAST RESOURCE”, while there’s still options like wider economical embargoes and better diplomatic strategies, for example."

Apart from India you also have Japan, South Korea( both of them will most probably have US' support), Vietnam and Indonesia ( Both of them are considerably powerful as well, considering their size, population and economy). 


All in all, I don't see why you would think South East Asian countries don't have strong militaries. Don't forget that in case of such a conflict, world's supply chains will be affected. This will probably cause the western powers to support the countries against china, since they'll already be facing economical problems due to the war."

But for most of tthe countries this would mean fighting a war at a small/moderate portion of their border. For China it'll mean fighting battles at all their borders. For India it will probably mean fighting a war with both China and Pakistan.

2020-06-22 15:37:52,dekachin5,"&gt; North Korea will never have the same might China has, it is too small a country. 

Doesn't matter. We need to keep NK as weak as possible.

&gt;Both North and South Korea want to build ties, (granted, south korea somewhat less so after the happenings of the last couple weeks)

NK does not. NK blew up that cooperation building and has been engaging in brinkmanship. That's not what ""build ties"" looks like. All NK wants is to gain money without risks to the regime, so the elites who run NK can enjoy luxuries and repress its people.

&gt;I trust South Korea to handle that in a responsible manner.

I don't. Too many young SK people think along racist lines and feel more brotherhood towards NK than towards their actual allies like Japan. These people are fools and NK will manipulate them to its own advantage.

&gt;The folks in the south korean government aren't babies, don't treat them like ones.

Japan and the US can think for ourselves. Doing so is not treating SK like ""babies"". SK politics can be too conciliatory and selfish towards NK sometimes. 

&gt;They know North Korea far better than we do.

No they don't. Why would they? Physical proximity? OLDER SKs understand the NK threat very well. young SKs do not.

&gt;Your point about ""Deng Xiaoping-moment"" is amazingly american.

Ad hominem attack. My point is not invalid because you decide to characterize it as ""American"". 

&gt;If NK is to give up nukes, it will have to happen after years of building trust

That's nonsense. NK has no incentive to give up nukes if we choose to build trust. The only reason to give up nukes is out of fear of aggression and economic sanctions.

&gt;If we want NK to give something up it will have to be something else for the time being, we simply cannot start with nukes, it is not an option.

You're a weakling. Glad you're not involved in setting US foreign policy. You're just some Norwegian or something. Your opinion doesn't matter.

&gt;Keeping maximum pressure on NK will result in a continuation of todays situation, where when NK runs out of money they have to do gradually more batshit stuff until we let them have enough to keep going

Then we refuse to ""let them have enough"". Starve the fuckers out.

&gt;Alternatively revolution happens, and I would personally not like to see potentially millions of deaths and civil war in an east asian nuclear power just because we were too stubborn to let NK have nukes while attempting to restore ties between the koreas.

LOL, you want to prop up the evil genocidal Kim regime just because you're afraid people will die in a revolution? A revolution would be the best thing for NK. 

People like you are how Hitler was allowed to run amok. You're like Chamberlain. ""Peace at any cost"". 

&gt;The problem is literally that the US and other countries are dictating South Korea's foreign policy, and that they should stop

No thank you. US foreign policy exists for the US, not SK. We already guarantee SK's military defense. SK is basically irrelevant. We allow them to have their say. We could just ignore them and go bilateral with SK and act like SK doesn't exist. We don't. We give them a seat at the table. Sorry that's not enough for you, Norwegian. 

&gt;Letting NK have their nukes while rebuilding ties is a tough camel to swallow 

It's retarded policy. It would work out great for NK. Terrible for the US. 

I'm not saying we can't strike a grand bargain with Kim Jong Un and support his murderous regime in exchange for him giving up nukes, but literally all I care about, and all my fellow Americans care about, are the nukes. If the nukes are not on the table, then the only policy I support is maximum pressure until they are.

&gt;in order for NK's leadership to get rid of their nukes they must first trust that they will not die as a result.

That could be negotiated in the form of a grand bargain where we provide NK with military weapons and directly support his regime's ability to retain power. It would be a deal with the devil. The US would actually give NK technology and expertise in how to oppress its own people, monitor them, subjugate them, and to mount a powerful defense against foreign invasion. That's all NK would accept. No amount of ""making nice"" and ""bribes"" of food and oil would be acceptable to them. 

&gt;Kim Jong-un seems to be more friendly than the currently most seriously considered candidates to be his heir, this is the time to act.

Nope. We tried the bribery route previously and it was an abject failure. I don't support going that route again."

I mean for fucks sake Bolton even said the US is considering the ""Libya model"" for NK denuclearization. What the fuck. If NK is to give up nukes, it will have to happen after years of building trust, and after already having set up somewhat solid ties to south korea, probably even the west as well. If we want NK to give something up it will have to be something else for the time being, we simply cannot start with nukes, it is not an option.

Keeping maximum pressure on NK will result in a continuation of todays situation, where when NK runs out of money they have to do gradually more batshit stuff until we let them have enough to keep going, just like they started doing now. Alternatively revolution happens, and I would personally not like to see potentially millions of deaths and civil war in an east asian nuclear power just because we were too stubborn to let NK have nukes while attempting to restore ties between the koreas.

&gt;Why should Japan, the US, and others allow South Korea to dictate our foreign policy?

The problem is literally that the US and other countries are dictating South Korea's foreign policy, and that they should stop

Letting NK have their nukes while rebuilding ties is a tough camel to swallow but it is a necessary one if we want any sort of normalization to start happening, and no matter what happens, in order for NK's leadership to get rid of their nukes they must first trust that they will not die as a result. That is far from the case today.

Kim Jong-un seems to be more friendly than the currently most seriously considered candidates to be his heir, this is the time to act."

I didn't, though. I directly contradicted you. Your political views are pro-communist and you - a white canadian - chose to move to and live in CCP-dominated China, which you praise. 

You probably don't see yourself as communist, but you're probably more communist than the CCP, since the CCP doesn't care about exploitation and in fact actively encourages it."

terrible idea. look at how economic ties failed to liberalize China, and the CCP is now more aggressive than ever.

&gt;instead of demanding north korea give up nukes (which is frankly not a possibility barring revolution) 

Sure it is, you just have to keep maximum pressure on NK long enough and eventually NK will have its ""Deng Xiaoping moment"" and give up nukes in exchange for wealth.

[That submarine attack was an act of war.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROKS_Cheonan_sinking) NK and Iran both use brinkmanship and violent attacks to try to intimidate, terrorize, and extort their neighbors. If you ignore their extortion long enough, they escalate to acts of war. An act of war is ""starting a war"". 

NK doesn't have the money, logistical capability, or equipment to launch a true total war of aggression. If NK, tried, it would get absolutely demolished. That's why it needs nukes so badly: suddenly it doesn't matter if it had overwhelming conventional power anymore, all it needs to do is hold civilians hostage with nuke threats."

For me, if used defensively as a deterrent, it would be. I personally prefer when no war happens.

&gt; Just saying ""it doesn't matter what people think because I know I am right and I will act accordingly"" doesn't really make you right and in fact it's a big evidence you aren't, in fact, right.

Never said it made you right, but if you do believe you are right, there is no other way to protect yourself against adversaries in the world than sufficient deterrents.

It is not evidence that you are not right. I'm not arguing for a nation to do whatever it wants. I'm arguing that a nation should use the tool of the nuclear deterrent no matter what it stance happens to be. Nuclear deterrent stops wars, and stops your own nation from being interfered with. Whether there's some objective list of 'correct' national attitudes or not, if you wsnt what you believe is right to be protected, you need a physical form of protection, as the international stage is not a place where anything else divides ideology but physical strength. Negotiate and make alliances and promote understanding all you wish, as long as there's a reason for others to take you seriously and not walk over you.

There is nothing to gain *not* having nukes if you do not intend to use them, there is everything to gain on giving adversaries who defy international law a monopoly on them."

_Pakistan's military says Indian troops backed by artillery and long-range guns have opened fire on villages along the border on the Pakistani-administered side of the Kashmir region, killing a 13-year-old-girl_

(AP Photo/Fareed Khan\))

MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan -- Indian troops backed by artillery and long-range guns fired on villages along the border in the Pakistani-administered side of the Kashmir region, killing a 13-year-old-girl and wounding her mother and brother, local officials and Pakistan’s military said Sunday.

In a statement, the military blamed the Indian army for initiating Saturday night's “unprovoked ceasefire violation” in the villages of Hajipir and Bedori. It said Pakistani troops “effectively responded” to the Indian fire, without elaborating.

Mortars fired by Indian troops also damaged several homes, according to local media reports and government officials. In neighboring India, the local police blamed Pakistani troops for initiating the fire, saying Pakistani mortar shelling wounded five Indian civilians on their side of Kashmir, which is divided between the two countries and claimed by both in its entirety.

Pakistan and India often trade fire in the disputed Himalayan region, with both blaming the other side for initiating the fire. The latest incident comes days after Indian fire killed four villagers in Pakistani-administered Kashmir.

Tensions have soared between Pakistan and India since last August, when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist-led government revoked Muslim-majority Kashmir’s decades-old semi-autonomous status, touching off anger in Indian-controlled Kashmir and in Pakistan. Pakistan wants the changes reversed.

India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir since gaining independence from British rule in 1947."

2020-06-22 11:24:09,Chaos-Seed,A reaction time of weeks is abysmal. We'd have to just completely ignore flash points altogether and it would make strategic maneuvers incredibly difficult.
2020-06-22 11:22:48,Chaos-Seed,"Oh I don't disagree with you on that. other NATO nations have rarely if ever paid their fair share (it is supposed to be 2% of their GDP) and informed Americans have been pissed about that for a long time. Especially when people bring up how amazing and progressive these countries social programs are. They have their amazing welfare programs and free university and housing programs blah blah blah. I'm sure its a lot easier to pay for things like that when you only have to concern yourself with 25% of your defense costs. What really needs to happen is for the USA to stick around long enough for other NATO nations to keep their promise and THEN pull out. The problem is in getting them to admit that they need to, and then actually do it. That is likely getting people to give up free money voluntarily with no benefit to them. As for why it would be concerning if those countries suffered economic or even territorial damage in the wake of a US withdraw, that's a lot to dismantle and I'm not an expert so I'd probably make a fool of myself trying to detail why I think it would be a problem. It might have a financial ripple effect that would be bad for us? Also weakening our allies who happen to be very close to a lot of our enemies probably strengthens our enemies which is just objectively bad of course."

They've built their market and their social programs around the fact that the USA is shouldering the bulk of the military burden in those areas and if that were suddenly not true anymore I'm not sure how nasty that butterfly effect might be, and that's all assuming that in whatever time frame was necessary for them to arm themselves properly something terrible didn't happen to them.

Obviously it was a wild election year, with more to come and rival it, but we can't say it was ugly from only one angle.

You're conflating candidate and party. They are not identical. Regardless, your outsider party would immediately become establishment once crowned, so that view can't really be the standard. 

&gt;All the major polls have shown even up to the election day that Hillary would win

Well obviously they were wrong, I wouldn't turn to those as a source. Historically, back to back democrats are very rare in our presidency, especially after an economic crisis like the recession. A republican in general was expected to win, though Trump being so unconventional people were worried he would upset that fairly sure thing.

It works like this- CO2 emissions are calculated as Carbon emitted per tonne of cargo moved. Cargo that travels a long way are put on bigger ships that move cargo much more efficiently than smaller ships. So a 24k TEU container ship produces far far less than 4 times the CO2 of a 6k TEU vessel.

So, oddly, it may be more carbon efficient to buy lamb from NZ than from somewhere closer."
2020-06-22 09:44:25,stampingpixels,"There's a fair bit of slight of hand in that report, and I'm struggling to understand what (aside from The Indy's anti-Brexit stance) I'm supposed to take away from it. 

As ever with clickbait, all the things I was hoping to learn weren't there about this story weren't there. 

One part I was hoping to understand better is how the study decided that additional trade with anyone is bad for the economy, what with trade being the thing that makes the actual economy. 

There's a number of legit answers to that point-- might antipodean trade crowd out more advantageous trade with other people, thus creating some sort of net loss? Could be: the article doesn't seem to say though. 

One other thing: how did the model at the heart of this study work? Because if the study used something derived from the gravity model of trade (as the treasury did for the original brexit bite impact model) then it would show this result. It would also be wrong as the gravity model of trade no longer works in this hyper connected world. 

Finally this corker from Lady Nugent, Emily Thornberry:

""47 per cent of our trade that depends on Europe is still hanging on the balance then that is where the government's priority should lie.""

Trade agreements don't guarantee anything. The definitely don't prevent trade, which is what Thornberry is implying there. 47% of nothing is hanging on the balance. Trade will happen irrespective of Brexit and trade agreements. Are you not going to buy a car because of brexit? Sure, a you might buy a Toyota rather than a VW, if no agreements get made and the price of a Golf increases relative to other models, but walking to the shops you won't be.

So Nazi Germany wasn’t? North Korea wasn’t? North Vietnam wasn’t? 

“The Republican Party is doing the same thing right now, right here in America. Why aren't you complaining about it?” 

No matter how much you really wanna circlejerk off to the idea that any right leaning person is a nazi, they’re far from it.

“The United States was directly responsible for killing almost 30% of the ENTIRE POPULATION of North Korea during the Korean War. Bet you didn't know that, did you? Puts their quest for nuclear weapons in a whole new light...”

What fucking bullshit source did you even get that from ya dumbass. First off, Korea wasn’t the Americans’ idea. North attacked South. The UN developed an emergency team composed of many nations, not just the USA, to combat the invasion.

“Venezuelans are starving BECAUSE OF AMERICAN SANCTIONS, not in spite of them. The country was selling their oil and gas in the United States until we stole their infrastructure, the company Citgo, their assets, their capital and now we've even directed Britain to steal their gold kept in the Bank of England. ALL ILLEGALLY.”

First, provide some reliable sources for whatever bullshit this is. Secondly, Venezuelans are starving because of Venezuela. It’s sad you really fucking think that Venezuela wouldn’t dump all that cash into their military, and not their population. Because as of right now, with how little they’re getting, all of it is going to the government. Not the people.

“Maybe you should learn something about foreign affairs before shooting off your mouth about American innocence abroad?”

First, right back at ya. Second, but! But! But! I thought! “I have the right to do so!”"

Actually I kind of see why Iran might want nukes, as Israel has them and they’re enemies so I see it could be a good detergent or whatever. Even if it’s just one nuke, that’s still powerful."

US has done some crazy shit and we know they have the resources for one nuke. We can both agree on that, they cannot make any more. If they do have more the nukes aren’t there’s or we’re just both wrong ig.

The Republican Party is doing the same thing right now, right here in America. Why aren't you complaining about it?

The United States was directly responsible for killing almost 30% of the ENTIRE POPULATION of North Korea during the Korean War. Bet you didn't know that, did you? Puts their quest for nuclear weapons in a whole new light...

Venezuelans are starving BECAUSE OF AMERICAN SANCTIONS, not in spite of them.

No, I don't think. I think that Iran calling France out on this is 100% fair. 

Right now, in this moment in history, try this on for size.

Replace ""France"" with ""White People"" and ""Iran"" with ""Black People"", then dig past the surface bullshit to look at the history and how many times ""White People"" (US, UK, USSR) have fucked with Iran's internal politics.

I mean, just go read the [Shah's Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi) and marvel at the level of fuckery that Old White Men have had in the country since (long before) 1941.

It's not shocking that Iran is the country that Iran is today.

2020-06-22 05:20:27,Solamentu,"I already made my point, the fact that international relationships are anarchic is exactly why a country that supposedly defends human rights and has a good will towards others should try to build up trust between nations, and why it is only through such actions one can know if a country is destructive or constructive in the international stage (which isn't the same as their actions at home, necessarily). Just saying ""it doesn't matter what people think because I know I am right and I will act accordingly"" doesn't really make you right and in fact it's a big evidence you aren't, in fact, right.

I'm sure the French think they are leagues better than the Iranians, and than almost everyone else for that matter, but if they act the way that way then they might not be better enough, not only for Iran, but for all the other countries in the world whose opinions (whatever europeans want to think) also matter. I already made the point, anyway, that the only objective reason one would trust country X over Y to hold a nuke, if one isn't from either, stems from a believe this country is less likely to use it than the next. If Iraq had had nukes I'm sure (as are the North Koreans) the Americans wouldn't have invaded them, and yet that's not reason enough to think that them having nukes would have been a good thing that other countries should accept."

You do not have to convince them of anything. The international political theatre is completely anarchic, as I think I said already. It's a situation where you provide a secure deterrent to keep your ideals in place or you allow other, oppressive and expansionist nations to claim you and control you.

Even on the part that says about communistic influences I can't seem to find a reference about a ""different definition"". All Marx did was to analyze the connection that private property has with the means of production, nothing about redefining the meaning of private property."

Then maybe you should inform yourself better. Everything is online these days, start with the French colonial wars and then go to French interventions in Africa and the middle east.

You can like whatever you like, but that's not a point that can be objectively defended against people who disagree with you (""I should have the bomb to defend against you because my way of life is superior"").

Yes you are funny but you still don’t really know what you are talking about.  I prefer to be anonymous but the people I’ve met from Eastern Europe would say that your perspective is complete bullshit, but it appears you are stuck in a rosy commie bubble where everything under Erich Honecker was great and nothing bad ever happened.  Yes you are ignorant and your Marx credentials don’t help you as the theory and practice are two different things.  It doesn’t sound like you realize that tho, which is what makes this farce of a debate even more funny."
2020-06-22 02:27:03,Aristocratic-Rabbit,"&gt; thats not the way communists define private property

So, commies want to change the definition of the word because it doesn't fit their narrative (it's not the first time they do this, CCP managed to rename concentration camps to ""re-education"" camps).

The one, sole true meaning of personal property is: ""A designation for the ownership of property by non-governmental legal entities."" So basically, everything you own that it's not related to a governmental entity."

Anyway, the argument sustains: we all choose when to trust sources. The source I went for is not a newspaper article, is not a historian, is not an opinion piece. Is a source of information of the US secretary of state. We know that because it was disclosed in an official FOIA request. Of course it could be wrong, but so could be any other info we have on the subject.

2020-06-22 01:33:22,GrislyMedic,Well I can say that the only reason I can afford having two boys of my own is the proximity of relatives who can watch my kids while I work. Parents need some sort of help with childcare while they work. I'm not sure how to do that though. Especially children before kindergarten. School age children can at least do after school activities at least in America. The other constraint is moving your family around. 5 people in one car is a huge pain in the ass. 4 is doable but 4 person families are below replacement.

2020-06-21 23:53:25,RealAbd121,"&gt; ""bapo224"" mentions that it could be seen as hypocritical to deny Iran nuclear weapons that we've been arming ourselves with for decades.

No, what bapo224 said was bringing up the idea of hypocrisy in general. The ""our leaders are dignified kings, their leaders are warlords"" saying.  

&gt;""okusername3"" gives salient reasons Iran is treated as a terrorist state right now (""the actual point at hand""). He didn't say anything about ""doing nothing wrong"", and he didn't say that European states never acted that way in the past. 

I'd disagree with calling his reasons Saliant, in fact, I'd argue he said the exact same thing bapo224 was pointing out. The ""our bombing of third world schools and homes is national defence, their bombings are terrorism"" (for the record, Both are Terrorism)    

As the point of ""He didn't say anything about ""doing nothing wrong"""" well, he did tho, how else do you interpret someone responding to ""Everyone is doing bad things"" with ""No, THEY are doing a bad thing"" If they didn't want to imply that those are unequal actions, their comment would be simply... redundant.   
like shouting ""all lives matter"" to someone saying BLM. you're being either redundant or implying they are mutually exclusive. 

&gt;You then brought up past European atrocities.  

I didn't, I followed up by a remark about how okusername3 is still missing the point by suggesting that Iran's action are inherently (more) evil than other nations playing the Geopolitical control game. This brings back the whole ""they're terrorist barbarians who want to commit genocide"" vs the west who only want nukes for defence and political games. I'm not interested in defending Iran or villainizing the west. But from Pure geopolitics, Iran has done nothing that makes any more Evil than Europeans that ""don't revere Western historical atrocities"". Who is Iran trying to commit genocide against? no one really? they have good relations with their minority population. their enemies are the Saudis (Who ARE actually committing Genocide in Yemen with the backing of the US), and Isreal, but those two both need the other to keep each other around because they're their national enemy and what they use as a scarecrow to keep their population united. like The USSR and the US, a direct war would never break out between the two. Otherwise, they're doing the very typical imperialism sphere of influence game. and need the nukes to act with impunity without having to worry about being invaded like Iraq. Most of the abnormally high Fear and hate on Iran is because they're the enemy of the US. compared with the Saudis who are viewed more favourably/less bad even though they're objectively way more evil! 

Iran is still a totalitarian shithole. and a Nuclear arms race in the middle east will only snowball and destabilize it even more. What I keep trying to say is that viewing other nations as a bunch of Irrational barbarians is at Best Eurocentric Hubres, and at worst a Strategically retarded decision like the one of considering Bin Ladin an insignificant nobody who's ""just a terrorist living in a cave"" and ignoring all the plethora of warning signs for 9/11!"

Also, mounting tension with Turkey about Libya and Greece (and a lot of smaller tension inducing situation) in the past few month, mean this test can also be a way to ""gently remind"" Turkey that they are ""allied"". 

This logic is also to be applied a bit more globally as a general reminder of France capabilities to hit anyone.

You then brought up past European atrocities. That was what turned it into a ""competition"" about history or excusing crimes. Until then, the question was ""can Europe ethically deprive Iran of nuclear weapons right now, because Iran may be about to commit genocide?"" But because you brought up the past, I responded that we don't revere Western historical atrocities in a way that makes it likely that we'll act like terrorist states in the future. 

You could make a convincing case to the contrary (e.g. Trumpism, AfD-type Euro political parties, or the Euro migrant crisis), but all this talk of exceptionalism and history is truly missing the question of whether it's valid to deprive Iran of nuclear weaponry while the West retains it."

 Interesting choice of words

Here's the thing, No one is Arguing that Iran (or any of the others) Aren't a bunch of fuckers. That is what you would personally call whataboutism per your comment somewhere up. 

The thing we were talking about is; This is a post about Iran pulling the ""you're a hypocrite"" card because when you delegitimize your opponents you somewhat invalidate their criticism, this has been practically been Russia's foreign policy since Putin. The thing that got us into this argument is that you/the person who made the original comment responded with essentially ""No, we aren't hypocrites the unlike them West did nothing wrong.""   

My Opposition that to statement is that   
1) it's wrong.     
2) it is concerned with defending the West rather than calling out Iran's tactic.     

IMO the Correct response would be the obvious 'someone else's crimes Does absolutely nothing to excuse yours and the world isn't a race to the moral bottom'  

Who wins the competition for the most evil nation is wholly irrelevant here. Yet Your responses were still more concerned with exceptionalism than with the actual point at hand. And you can clearly see that when you responded to me calling you a Eurocentric by listing out other nation's crimes. Instead of condemning Horrible actions, you are more interested in pointing out how they make the west less bad compared to other places. which is again, neither I nor the article were concerned with! But I'm sure the thousands dying in camps are happy being reduced to a gallery of reasons why We are better than those... others.  


Also... you unironically used 'flippant'"

However the fact that China with almost 1.4 billion people almost eradicated Covid-19 is not a lie. No other country, except perhaps Korea was able to be so effective in stalling and then eliminating it.

2020-06-21 21:05:17,bapo224,"Population of the Falkland islands is majority British by a very large margin unlike Hawaii which you invaded a century and a half after the British settled the Falkland islands. Yes, the French did start an unjust war over 70 years ago but since then the US has caused many more even inciting several civil wars some of which are still ongoing today.

Very funny how you accuse Europe of meddling in foreign affairs when the US has militarily intervened in the politics of Lebanon, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Guyana, Vietnam, Grenada, Libya, Panama, Iraq, Haiti, Afghanistan and the Philippines. It's also been shown the US covertly intervened in the elections of over 80 countries between the 50s and 2000. 

You could argue a couple of those to be justified but all of them boil down to America playing world-police and enforcing their own politics onto other nations through military oppression.

Especially the Iraqi disarmament war was absolutely dreadful. Lots of breaches of the Geneva convention and general violations of basic human rights. 

Additionally the US intentionally destabilized many nations by supporting dissident organizations (often outright terrorists) and literal coup d'etat attempts. This includes the installation of a fascist dictator in Chile, arming and funding a Kurdish terrorist cell in Iraq, funding several Afghan rebel groups (including bin Laden's organization which later became Al-Qaeda), supporting Angolan revolutionaries, supporting right wing rebels in Nicaragua, supporting right wing rebels in Cambodia and staging a coup attempt in Iraq.

The CIA has also (attempted) assassinations on many world leaders especially in the 60s including Congo's Lummumba, Dominica's Trujillo, Indonesia's Sukarno, South-Vietnam's Dinh Diem, Chile's Allende, Libya's Gaddafi, Serbia's Milosevic and Iraq's Hussein.

The US has also (assumedly with good intentions to be fair) created massive power vacuums in many countries which in recent years have caused civil war in Libya, escalation in Yemen's civil war and prolonged the civil war in Syria."

2020-06-21 20:58:39,DCFY7439,"Though government officials have spoken of Chinese aid in the hundreds of millions of dollars—which they swear will consist only of grants, not loans that would risk trapping Kiribati in debt it could not repay to China—they have not provided much detail. But when Maamau made his first state visit to Beijing, he signed a Belt and Road Memorandum of Understanding that involved only loans, according to Berina, who was still the ruling party’s chairman at the time. His claim could not be verified immediately.

A vivid illustration of China’s interest in Christmas Island came in an official [photograph](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-01-06/Xi-Jinping-meets-Kiribati-s-president-in-Beijing--N2gIPad7xe/index.html) of the signing ceremony showing Maamau facing Chinese President Xi Jinping, with the minister for the Line Islands, of which Christmas is a part, on his right. Mikarite Temari, the minister, is a relatively peripheral figure in Kiribati politics but key to developing Christmas and its port infrastructure.

Kiribati sources said the campaign ahead of Monday’s election has focused largely on China: Would it use aid promises and bribes to flood the country with its workers to build white elephant projects, possibly bringing COVID-19 to one of the last nations devoid of it, as the opposition claims? Will it press its expansionist agenda, taking over Christmas just as China tried, within days of gaining recognition from the Solomons, to lease all of Tulagi Island, the former capital under British and Japanese rule with a perfect deep-water harbor? Or will the Maamau administration hold firm and take only grants that materially benefit the population, such as for adaptation measures against sea-level rise and tourism infrastructure to lure visitors from Hawaii, for whom pristine Christmas is the closest accessible tropical atoll?

Tito, the U.N. and U.S. envoy, said that even though it gives no aid to Kiribati, the United States remains popular for cultural and historical reasons, not least for having liberated what was then still a British protectorate from Japanese occupation in the 1943 Battle of Tarawa. When Kiribati gained independence from Britain a little more than 40 years ago, it signed a friendship treaty with the United States under which no military installations can be built in Kiribati by other countries without Washington’s consent. Though he found it hard to imagine, Tito said that the treaty’s abrogation, with due six-month notice, was “possible.”

The global strategic significance of Kiribati’s election on Monday could therefore not be higher. Whether China continues its expansion across the Pacific to displace the United States and its allies may very well be decided by this tiny island nation."
2020-06-21 20:58:31,DCFY7439,"A watershed moment in China’s expansion across the Pacific toward the Americas will unfold Monday when Kiribati, a country with only 110,000 inhabitants that controls a vast expanse of ocean, decides whether to reelect a pro-China president or choose a challenger pledged to recognize Taiwan. 

At stake for China is the possibility of gaining a foothold in Kiribati’s Christmas Island, the world’s biggest atoll with a land area of 150 square miles. It’s located just 1,300 miles south of Honolulu, home to the U.S. Pacific Command. Building port facilities on Christmas Island, ostensibly for tourism but capable of use by Chinese warships, is a concern for the U.S. military. 

For Taiwan, reversing Kiribati’s 2019 defection—which brought the number of countries worldwide that recognize its existence as a sovereign nation down to [15](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3029626/taiwan-down-15-allies-kiribati-announces-switch-diplomatic)—would be a significant victory for President Tsai Ing-wen. Still, “China has more to win than Taiwan has to lose at this point,” said Natasha Kassam of the Lowy Institute in Sydney. Even if the pro-China candidate wins, “the domestic political cost of switching allegiances in Kiribati has already served its purpose as a cautionary tale to other partners of Taiwan,” Kassam told *Foreign Policy*.

When Kiribati President Taneti Maamau announced last September his decision to switch his country’s support to Beijing, even members of his own party were surprised. In fact, Kiribati’s ambassador to the United Nations and United States, Teburoro Tito (himself a former Kiribati president), was in the U.N. secretary-general’s office arguing the case for Taiwan to attend meetings organized by the U.N. when he learned of the decision. Maamau was elected in 2016 on a pledge to retain ties with Taiwan, which his predecessor, Anote Tong, had initiated in 2003. 

The sudden switch to Beijing did not go down well in Kiribati. Demonstrations were held with protesters waving Taiwanese flags and chanting, “We love Taiwan, we hate China, we want peace.” The leader of the opposition, Titabu Tabane, accused the government of failing to consult the people.

The move also caused enough members of parliament from Maamau’s party, including its chairman, Banuera Berina, to bolt to the opposition and deprive Maamau of his previously comfortable majority when a new parliament was elected in April.

According to Kiribati sources, there were several reasons for Maamau’s switch from Taiwan to Beijing.

First, Maamau’s administration has espoused multiple scientific studies that predict his country’s sand islands will gain elevation in tandem with a sea level expected to rise by 1 meter by century’s end—not drown within decades as prophesied by his predecessor, Tong. So Maamau has embarked on an ambitious [program](http://www.mfed.gov.ki/sites/default/files/KIRIBATI%2020-YEAR%20VISION%202016-2036%20.pdf) to develop the country and lift his people out of poverty, leveraging tourism—mostly on Christmas Island—and the tuna fishery.

For that, the government decided it needed two long-range, 92-seat [Embraer](https://embraer.com/global/en/news?slug=1206681-air-kiribati-receives-its-first-e190-e2-jet) aircraft to [link](https://australianaviation.com.au/2018/12/air-kiribati-to-go-the-distance-with-embraer-e2-order/) Tarawa, the capital island, to Christmas 2,000 miles to the east—and to the world beyond. It reportedly paid $60 million for one aircraft and asked Taiwan for a grant to buy the second one—a tall order given that Taiwan’s annual aid to Kiribati was around $10 million. Taiwan demurred, in keeping with Tsai’s opposition to checkbook diplomacy. Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu, in his announcement of the diplomatic break, put it this way: “[Maamau](https://www.mofa.gov.tw/en/News_Content.aspx?n=1EADDCFD4C6EC567&amp;s=188AF2A01C4EDB7D) has requested massive financial assistance from Taiwan to purchase commercial airplanes.” Instead, Wu said, Taiwan offered to provide a preferential commercial loan, but it was rejected by Kiribati.

However, Berina—the former party leader, defector, and now Maamau’s challenger in Monday’s election—said in an interview that he was told that Taiwan had given Kiribati officials a very different story. They allegedly offered Kiribati a grant covertly disguised as a loan: When its repayment came due, Taiwan would increase bilateral aid in proportion, so the loan reimbursement would be covered by Taiwan. The claim could not be verified.

A second reason for the switch to Beijing, according to government sources, is that the ruling party leadership feared that Taiwan would give money to the opponents of Maamau and his party in this year’s parliamentary and presidential elections. Members of Maamau’s party, when they were in the opposition from 2003 to 2016, often complained that Taiwan gave cash at election time to parliamentarians of then-President Tong’s party, and the leaders of Maamau’s party feared the old alliance would reemerge. Under Kiribati law, there are no restrictions on who may give money to elected officials, and Kiribati is in the bottom third of the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index.

A third reason, proffered by the pro-Taiwan opposition, is in line with complaints about Chinese bribery offers in small countries that suddenly found themselves in Beijing’s embrace, such as the Solomon Islands, which flipped allegiances four days before Kiribati. There, Daniel Sudaini, premier of the Solomon’s largest island, Malaita, told an [Australian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzCqQKnF9Oo) *60 Minutes* team that he was offered (and had turned down) $1 million to back the switch. He added on [camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzCqQKnF9Oo) that he thought there were a lot of corrupt officials in his government. 

The Australian crew, on a tour of the Pacific to investigate China’s expansion, had just traveled to Tarawa in Kiribati when it was placed under house arrest at its hotel upon arrival because, officials said, it lacked proper authorizations to film. Before they were expelled on the next plane out, the journalists were visited in their hotel by Ieremia Tabai, Kiribati’s first president who is now an opposition parliamentarian, and Tabane, the opposition leader. The latter called their detention “a sad day for democracy.” A reporter quoted them as saying that China had “doled out A$250,000 cash within weeks of Kiribati’s recognition of Beijing.” (Kiribati’s currency is the Australian dollar.) 

In an interview with *Foreign Policy*, Berina, the opposition presidential candidate, said that when Maamau announced the switch and several parliamentarians protested that Taiwan was popular and they feared losing their seats as a result of the switch, Maamau told them not to worry “because we will be getting campaign money from China.” Berina added: “I was shocked.”"

2020-06-21 20:43:10,Abrruti,"It's not the feasability of the soviet invasion but the threat of it that became quite real with the collapse of Manchuria. 

The japanese emperor feared very much the prospect of having an atheist communist force to have a say in the splitting of the main japanese lands into areas of influence similar to Germany. 

One of the other argument that I find quite convincing is that the emperor, being divine and without a default, could explain his loss by a quasi divine scientific advance rahter than its own strategic mistakes. It also allowed the dynasty to outlive its defeat, which wouldn't be possible with the soviets in the picture."

Iran on the other hand not so much. 

Now, how does this relate to Nuclear war? It's due to the fact that I'd call France more responsible and can assure that these arms will not be used recklessly. De-nuclearisation is impossible in the near future, which ironically means that the only way to assure peace is through Nuclear arms, since they act as mutual deterrents.

So do I think France is in the wrong and this whole thing is hypocritical? Not at all.

Do I think that we should remove these weapons from the face of the earth? Probably, but how you'd even start doing that is beyond me for now. Even then, will it truly achieve peace?

Neither russia or the US go around actively threatening to wipe entire countries and ethnic populations off of the map because of cultural/religious disputes, so i would be inclined to trust both Russia and the US more than Iran 

That goes without saying, the world's nuclear arsenal has been drawn down from 70,000 at its peak to 14,000, the majority being US and Russian stockpiles, so you've already got your wish. Its already happening.

If you dont trust either the US or Russia, you have every reason not to trust france, or any other nuclear armed country on earth.

France is very clearly just as indiscriminate as the US, seeing as theyre still involved in major colonial disputes in the 21st fuckin century, and are the cause of numerous other wars like the Vietnam War (which...funny... was another colonial dispute).

On the other side you have pariah states who don’t want those things and mostly seem to be interested in staying in power. Both are more than willing to use force.

&gt; A former Chicago businessman imprisoned for aiding terrorist groups has been arrested in Los Angeles to face murder charges in India for the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks that killed more than 160 people, U.S. prosecutors said Friday.

&gt; Tahawwur Rana, a Pakistani-born Canadian, has been charged in India with conspiring to plot and carry out the deadly attacks that are sometimes referred to as India&amp;#039;s 9-11.

&gt; Rana&amp;#039;s lawyer said at trial that he had been duped by his high school buddy, David Coleman Headley, an admitted terrorist who plotted the Mumbai attacks.

2020-06-21 17:44:46,PikaPant,"True, but there are a couple of problems:  
  
The reason it would be a convenient excuse for India to destroy that road is because not only is the CPEC road super close to India(it passes through PoK), super close to Galwan Valley too, now that I mention it. In the event of any escalation, India can 'accidently' launch a missile or two at it and total it, and in a moment ruin Xi's entire flagship BRI initiative worth trillions.  
  
Meanwhile, there is barely any significant infrastructure close to either Indian or Chinese border that is even close to as economically important to India as the CPEC is to Pakistan and China. The only one that is even remotely as important would be the DSDBO road over which China is attacking India to begin with, and it's the most militarised and protected road on the planet today, and still nowhere near as important to India as CPEC is to China and Pakistan.  
  
On top of that, Pakistani Military sucks compared to India, and there's little they can do to really hurt India. Even China can't really do much to India on the mountain border. If this escalates into a full scale war though, other nations come into play, and it's another rabbit hole."

This requires Turkey, Iran and Iraq give up land, which they aquired hundreds of years ago. Supporting small state mentality is naturally contrary to western beliefs as USA and EU show how promising working together is. The UK exiting the EU just gets to show how much of an impact such decision has and the EU isn't even as internally connected as the US or the Turkish with the Kurdish.

I see why PKK was founded. In the 80s Kurdish people didn't have much rights and were oppressed. Today 15 million kurdish people live in Turkey, habe their own party, their own rights and are fully integrated into society. They even go as far as teaching kurdish in schools. So I don't see a legitimacy for this terrorist group to exist. Do you? 

It's not as easy as saying ""just fight the root cause"". The root cause has been tackled 20 years ago. Western people say Turkish are discriminating against kurdish. But discriminating against 1/5 of the population wouldn't work in the first place."

It's time to fire the oligarchs who run the United States and stop with the military adventurism for profit. We cannot afford it and it will crush us soon if we don't change our approach.

America is already known as being incapable of making and sticking to its agreements and other countries, most notably China, are taking advantage. 

I know a lot about our diplomatic corps and as such I'm keenly aware of how badly we are underutilising it. This must change or we'll find ourselves ostracised by the world's nations like an ill tempered brat in elementary school."

No, it's not. It's a demonstration of power to show ""who's boss"", bc not a single western country will criticise France for it, which further strengthens their move.

We see the very same behaviour in America with their problems surrounding police brutality. 1000 good cops become 1000 bad cops if they stay silent against the brutality.

What I'm trying to say is France single handedly alienated Iran from the West. Well, maybe not single handedly, bc America bombed one of their leaders, but it still makes things worse. I fully expect for France to support troops who fight against Turkey and Iran, no matter if they're terrorists or not. Syria is the prime example for this. So let's not pretend that western countries always stand for progressive and democratic values. Osama Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, Arab Spring and Israel-Palestinian conflict were all created by the wes. 

Give me a reason not to see Frances actions threatening. History tells me a different story. Their current political climate tells me a different story."
2020-06-21 15:51:42,ttystikk,"Taking these one at a time;

The notion that America doesn't use its military aggressively is complete bullshit; we're innocents in half a dozen conflicts around the world and we're winning none of them.

So you're fine with America occupying a foreign nation we lied to the world to attack when it has done nothing to America or its allies (don't bring up Kuwait, that was dealt with a decade before). Further, you're saying that we have any right to stay even though we aren't welcome and get nothing- let me repeat- NOTHING for being there, other than munitions tossed our way. No, there is no security upside to our presence; it's all liabilities.

Libya was destabilised and destroyed by the US so its current plight has everything to do with us. We wrecked it for no good reason and now you think it's okay to just leave it twist? I'm sure that sends a lovely message to other nations!

It was Yemen that attacked Saudi Arabia's oil production. They haven't tried since. The United States bungled a false flag 'attack' on oil tankers in a Saudi port, which cost us yet more credibility. Yemen has hung on against SA, in spite of our support, so we look bad yet again. Peace is coming on Yemeni terms, not ours.

The United States has accomplished exactly what in Afghanistan? Being shot at long enough to raise a child to the age of majority. And what else? Fuck all, as usual

We entered Syria and got kicked out unceremoniously because it was made clear that it would cost far more than it was worth to stay. That's called losing, fool.

Pakistan has been the recipient of a great deal of American airlines and attention; yet our bad behavior around the world has made them understandably wary of us and our influence with them has suffered. That's also a foreign policy failure. No one gave Pakistan ready made nukes; they developed those themselves.

I don't know where you get your information from but it's all fucking wrong- and worse, you're a feckless Imperialist who thinks it's cool to go screwing with the rest of the planet for kicks while killing millions of innocent civilians and you think somehow that will never cost us.

2020-06-21 15:34:25,dekachin5,"&gt; it has become clear that America's military hammer can't just make every other nation into a nail, no matter how much they might want to make it so.

Sure it can. Americans just don't desire to use our military that aggressively. If we wanted to use it, though, we are confident that we would win.

&gt;being told to leave Iraq

meaningless. the US troops aren't going anywhere anytime soon, and if they leave it will be on a timetable set by the US, not dictated by Iraq.

&gt;a mess in Libya

I don't see what that has to do with the US. I opposed the US getting involved against Gaddafi, but that was in 2011, 9 years ago.  It's not a US problem anymore and hasn't been for a long time.

&gt;can't protect Saudi Arabian oil assets

Of course we can, although that is really SA's responsibility, not ours. After Iran's sneak attack carefully planned to exploit a blind spot in SA's defenses (SA's defenses are designed to stop big targets, not small drone swarms), we increased support to SA, and there have been no further attacks. Mission accomplished. 

&gt;couldn't swing the tide against Yemen

The US military isn't involved in Yemen. If we were, it would be over very quickly. 

&gt;Afghanistan is at a standstill 

By ""standstill"" you mean the US continues it's 19-year unbroken string of victory in keeping Afghanistan out of Taliban control. Winning. 

&gt;now negotiating with the Taliban

It makes sense to do so as long as the Taliban has learned its lesson and never again tries to challenge the US. The US taxpayer doesn't want to pay to provide security to Afghanistan forever. Our war goal there was to punish the Taliban for its complicity in the 9/11 attacks. We are willing to continue the fight as long as the Taliban is willing to cling to its suicidal ideals.

&gt;Syria has chewed up and spit out American intervention

[Nope.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Khasham) America proved that it was far superior to the Russians and Syrians in military power even when we fought with extremely limited assets. 

If the United States WANTED to be in Syria, we could come in and win the war for whatever side we chose very quickly. The only reason that doesn't happen is that we really don't give a shit. 

&gt;Pakistan is wary of American ""help"" and has turned towards China in a big way

That's laughable. Pakistan has been a Chinese client since many decades ago. You're trying to pretend this is a recent development. China gave Pakistan nukes back in the 70s/80s."

There's a really obvious reason for this. France is a peaceful country that hasn't exhibited aggression or threatened other countries. Iran, on the other hand, is an extremely aggressive country:

- engages in widespread terrorism in Iraq 

- sponsors terrorism abroad

- repeated attacks on international shipping

- launched an air strike against Saudi Arabia

- attacked a US drone in international waters

Not to mention that Iran calls for the destruction of Israel, the United States, and whoever else gets their panties in a bunch on a regular and routine basis.

So when Iran tests a missile, it's pretty different from France testing a missile, don't you think? The obvious reason being: nobody expects France to USE said missile aggressively, everyone expects Iran to do so."

This suggests that. even absent treatment in hospital COVID sufferers still have at least a 98% survival rate. 

The CDC could be wrong, or Brazil might be a special case, but I doubt that your infection fatality rate is anything close to 5%. Italy has the second oldest population in the world, and their health care system was completely overwhelmed, yet they still reported a *case* fatality rate of only 3.4%. Based on how there are typically many, many times the number of infections as there are cases (like 50 to 80 times), Italy's *infection* fatality rate was most certainly much lower.

IMO you should be skeptical of such high mortality numbers."

Apart from that Iran has no terrorist group, ironically israel was founded by terrorist, and israel built it's nuclear programme by hijacking and terroring cargo ships and stealing uranium.

If you think those countries have terror groups, you should read about the bombs USA dropepd on Japan that killed hundreds of thousands. That's real use weapons of mass destruction.

"" Landkreis bzw. Stadt  Bundesland  Fälle / 7 Tage (absolut)  Inzidenz / 7 Tage · 100.000 Ew.  Schwerpunkt    [Kreis Gütersloh](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kreis_G%C3%BCtersloh) NW 325 89,3  Fleischverarbeitende Betriebe  ""

Basically stating that the most cases from that city came from the slaughterhouse. 

I wonder if this can explain the small surges of a few hundred we saw in the last days :

Both should be held to the same standards and both of them should be criticised for breaking status quo. 

It also should be noted here, that France had a confrontation with Turkish soldiers when one of their warships got radar flashed by Turkey.

Its also of importance that Iran and Turkey are doing military actions against terrorists in Northern Iraq.

France also has a track record of selling multiple terrorist groups weapons. ISIS, PKK, YPG. They also sold weapons to Syria to fuel the warmongering.

Yes, you may try to pretend it would be taken down in a fit of angry straw man, but the fact is so far only statues on public land were taken down, and the private confederate museum or private stuff none was touched. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That's called double standards.   

No that is called a straw man. 

&gt;who would back up someone that had a Hitler statue in this day and age 

Setting aside your straw man about private statues being attacked (to which to my knowledge there was none - even if gifted by private parties all those statues were on public space for public consumption) :

If the US government attempted to destroy a private state the **EFF** would \*immediately\* go to the rescue and the fight, as **they defend free speech no matter if far right, far left , or whatnot**. And in the case which interest us , in Germany - not even the US, the cities tried to disallow them and got banged by a judge. 

**The \*private people/firms\* on the other hand has NO duty to defend any speech.** This is why social media is free to censor anything they want (and don't cite section 230 until you understood what it meant and WHY it does not apply here), and, where the government give you a right of free speech (in the US) ,  the general public has a right to make you feel the consequences of it, among other being shunned by the communities at large, protested against, or boycotted. 

The general public does not have OTOH the right to destroy private properties and I think as far as possible  whenever there is evidence rioter will be pursued."

2020-06-21 12:34:02,Leptine,"Making a coalition requires enough animosities and willpower for it, as long as the Chinese government were only taking minor displeasing acts, they didn’t want to cause a conflict that’d end up being bad for them. But right now China has crossed the line from minor to major actions, and those create the need to curb the Chinese even if they have to pay the price for it.

You used Taiwan as an example of how they lack the willpower, but it is Anglo’s example on why they didn’t act. Taiwan is a minor player in the region and wouldn’t have the weight to make China think twice if they had sided with it, so siding with Taiwan was always only a con for them. It was a minor issue.

But now that China is threatening the sovereignty of some countries, it turned into a major issue, so they have to act. Another thing is: no other country put its weight behind Taiwan to show you that it was favorable to have a relationship with them (the us is an ally of Taiwan but they didn’t care to do it either,  it officially they don’t recognize it but they have treaties with them as if they were independent.)

You can see how the China threatening stance is being recepted by the countries around it as something major, by how they have reacted with their defense budget. Even japan is spending more on its military and reactiving military units that were prohibited, they are changing their own laws to be able to invest more on their defense and power projection so they can prepare against the Chinese. It is not anymore a matter of “will they”, it’s a “when will they do it” now. 

Right now China has two options. It can try to minimize the amount of animosity around it (hard to do without them making concessions that they absolutely don’t want to) and laying low for a few years (they will never take this option because they wan to topple the us)
Or it can continue with it’s very aggressive actions and accept that sooner or later it will have a coalition against them. They will pick this option, because China has a inbuilt conception that the west is weak and lacks the willpower to stand up to them. (The west is very divided right now but nothing like a common outside agressor to unite people again)

Nonetheless, in my opinion, a war is inevitable. History has shown us that in almost every instance where a emerging power challenges a hegemon, it ends up in war."

Usually only one of these has any teeth: the US. But it's clear that the current administration there isn't exactly trying to hold China accountable.

&gt; FRANKFURT - More than 1,000 employees at German meat processing firm Toennies have tested positive for coronavirus, prompting local health authorities to order all 6,500 employees and their families to go into quarantine.

&gt; Speaking at a press conference on Saturday, the meat company&amp;#039;s proprietor, Clemens Toennies, said the outbreak presented an &amp;quot;Existential crisis&amp;quot; for his firm, which has suspended operations as authorities seek to control the outbreak.

&gt; The outbreak may force the German state of North Rhine Westphalia to impose a broader lockdown.

I specified that any conflict would be like the last two btwn India and China eg limited.

Neither side is going to use nukes over some uninhabited mountains either. If this fighting was going on in Arunchal which is probably more 'core' India a full war would be likely but not in the Northern sectors of the LAC

&gt;Not to mention that these two countries are meet up at the G7 (India is a guest) and are both top 5 economies. They also have multi billion dollar trading agreements

China is not in the G7. India China trade is around 85b which is large but not insurmountable, and considering Indias protectionist tendencies it wouldnt be out of the ordinary. 

&gt;They would never risk the economic turmoil from warring against each other.

Again limited war

&gt;They also both have nuclear triads

Slavery was the best thing that ever happened to the slaves and their descendants because it got them the fuck out of Africa. 

We compare slaves to white people and say it's unequal, but the real comparison is comparing slaves to their fellow tribesmen who escaped enslavement.

No, you said it is taught in the US. That's a lie.

&gt;We literally went to Africa and ripped family members away from each other

No we did not. That's not how the slave trade worked, which you already know because you followed your idiotic comment with something that immediately contradicted yourself:

&gt;while paying other Africans to hunt down and enslave their brethren.

- I don't know who ""we"" is, because I sure as fuck didn't trade any slaves, and neither did you.

- Slave traders were international merchants, not all Americans.

- Slave traders only emerged as a response to African tribes choosing to enslave their enemies as a means of creating trade value to obtain luxuries and weapons. White people didn't tell them to enslave anyone. If they did, you would have seen slavery all around the world and not just in west africa as the ""evil white man"" forced everyone into it. Nope, slavery was 100% blacks victimizing other blacks, and the slave traders were just taking advantage of an economic opportunity like all other merchants do."

Xi and Modi won’t ever let it get that far because both of them know the potential for destruction and mass casualties should an all out war happen. I believe this incident will just lead to more defined and agreed upon borders. 

Besides, this is all just hypothetical talk. I don’t think we’ll ever see a world war, at least not in our life time. How would that even play out anyways? This isn’t the 1940s. The nuke isn’t the deadliest weapon in our arsenal. Our tools for war are about 100 times more deadly than they were back then.

Because from here it just looks like classic neoliberal virtue signaling where the performance is more important than actual change. And there will be zero self-reflection on what was actually achieved through this exercise. I think the actual reason is more sinister: going through the motions of condemning China acts as a smokescreen for these same countries to continue their business-as-usual relationships with China and proxies. It allows politicians to take a tough stance without actually doing something that would threaten their wealth and power. It’s all bread and circuses.

Feel free to ignore my comment, but since you asked I'll explain.

There's a lot of US hate going around, (and I gladly partake) but saying stuff like ""the US schools still teach that slaves were willing"" makes me immediately distrust you based on my experience. It's a pretty damning generalization for a big and diverse country. 

If you qualified it somehow like: ""*some* schools"" or ""*there are many* schools"" and linked it to an article to spread information, that would be helpful. Then you would be spreading awareness of the facts and not hearsay.

Example: It's like how word has been spreading with the protests that Police in the US were formed from what were originally slave patrols. *That's true* **but** that doesn't actually apply to the idea of police or law enforcement, it wasn't the first form of police in the US, and it still only applies to former slave states.

And that doesn't mean US law enforcement isn't fucked regardless of that.

It's a good thing to spread awareness on but without a citation, that awareness becomes a game of telephone."
2020-06-21 03:05:10,manicmangoes,"Born and raised in Alabama and went to AL public schools. Slavery is not taught with such a tainted lense here. If anything we have a more detailed history taught of the evils of slavery, Jim crow. I remember visiting the Civil rights museum on multiple field trips in elementary school. No doubt there may be a few outliers but I have never heard the argument that slavery was at the behest of those enslaved. We did learn that there were isolated cases of slaves that remained with their masters after the fall of the south but those were attributed to a lack of education and opportunity during reconstruction. No doubt the southern democrats did everything in their power to prevent individual freedoms being granted to the black community. But you could make that same argument during Jim Crow, civil rights and even today."

The EU might could be, and probably is more pro-China, but China would consider them pro-India/US.  Russia would be seen as pro-China.  Every other major government would be considered pro-China or pro-India, out side of tiny countries with no clout or corrupt countries that neither side trusts.

I think China is going to keep pushing more and more until they get stopped by the collective world community.

If its stopped soon enough...maybe not.

2020-06-21 02:35:46,Renathras,"Here's the problem with that:

China is going to keep getting worse as they gain more power and the US loses power with time.  People who hate the US don't seem to realize this, or wantonly cheer it, not realizing China is objectively worse with LESS power, they will be objectively worse with MORE power.

Within its sphere, China has shown a complete disregard to sovereignty and national claims of its neighbors, Human rights at home and abroad, and engages in predatory lending against poor nations to gain more control and power.

That doesn't get better with China gaining more power and its hegemony growing.

It also doesn't take the whole world.  It only takes the largest/most powerful nations.  For example, Europe, Russia, India, the US, Canada, Brazil, and Australia, joined together, could VERY QUICKLY check China and they would come back to the negotiating table with hand outstretched.

We stand together or we fall apart: A truth as old as time.

The fact you see not bending the knee as ""puffing your chest and looking strong"" is part of the problem.  You've fallen for the progressive false dichotomy of the world where one is either a chauvinist bully or is a contrite self-flagellating egalitarian.

THAT is the false dichotomy."

2020-06-21 02:09:44,Leptine,"China has been very agressive against its neightboors as of late, any country involved in the ""South China sea"" issue feels very threatened by them right now. So theyçve been pushed towards the US sphere of influence, who no doubt wishes to set up a coalition against China). You also have South Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Australia, all of them have showed an increasing interest in cubring China's power. India is being thrown towards a conflict with China, as well, (and has been surrounded by the Pearl necklane strategy. India is a very, very old ally of the Russians, and they have a very good relationship). So TL\`DR:

Against China Coalition: US (1st World power), India (4th world power), Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Philippines (out of the affected by the south china sea, i feel they are the most prone to join). OTAN (biggest military alliance in the world).

Neutral: Russia (Russia would never join China on a conflict against India, India is a very old ally of Russia and Russia has showed that it prefers their old friends over new ones (an example of that was russia ditching Turkey over Syria.) Pakistani relationship with China is very friendly, but I doubt they'd join a war on the side of China due to it's relationship with the Saudi, a very big ally of the US and a brotherhood ally of Pakistani)

China Coalition: China, North Korea (which is essentially a vassal state of China), there are other ""buddies"" of China, but they'd most likely stay out of any war.

It doesn't matter how good is the Russia-Chino relationship, Russia would never join a war on the side of China, simply because it's too risky. OTAN is directly at their borders, and China is simply not worth it. You can argue that Russia would prefer to have US as world power, rather than China, simply because China shared direct borders with Russia, and undoubtly, if China wins, they will at some point be an enemy of Russia, because you cannot have two Hegemons."

Liberals want to reduce pollution to reduce climate change effects? Trump rallies to increase coal mining / production, neuter the EPA, pull out of all emmision reducing agreements, etc.

Liberals want everyone to have accessible healthcare and education. Republicans rail against both ideas. Trump appoints Betsy Devos to secretary of edu whos best ideas were vouchers that benefit rich areas only. He wanted to revoke the ACA (Obamacare) but couldn't even think of anything better. 

A liberal could have the cure for cancer and Republicans would die before they acknowledged it"
2020-06-21 01:54:33,Langernama,"#European Citizens' Initiative: Council greenlights temporary extension of deadlines
Member states' EU ambassadors today endorsed, without amendments, the Commission's proposal to extend several deadlines linked to the European Citizens' Initiative due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The planned temporary measures, which would apply until the end of 2022, give organisers of initiatives more time to collect statements of support in order to reach the required threshold of one million signatures from across the EU.

For the initiatives that were ongoing on 11 March 2020, when the World Health Organization announced a worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, the one-year collection period would be extended by up to six months. For the initiatives that started collecting signatures after 11 March and before 11 September, the collection period would run until 11 September 2021.

The Commission would be able to further extend the collection period for initiatives, if necessary due to public health measures related to COVID-19, to a maximum of two years in total.

In addition, the proposed measures allow for an extension of the time limits for the verification of signatures in member states and for the examination of successful initiatives by the EU institutions.

The Council agreed its position on the measures as a matter of urgency in order to address the legal uncertainty affecting citizens, organisers, national administrations and the EU institutions, in particular where the time periods for the collection of statements of support, verification and examination of initiatives have already ended or are about to end.

The European Parliament will now have to vote on its position on these measures, which need to be agreed between the Parliament and the Council in order to be adopted.

##Background
Under the EU treaties, the European Commission has the sole right of legislative initiative, with exceptions in only a few areas.

The European Citizens' Initiative is an instrument of participatory democracy which enables one million EU citizens from at least one quarter of the member states to invite the Commission to propose a legal act in areas where it has the power to do so.

In the event of a successful European Citizens' Initiative, the Commission is required to provide its answer in a communication setting out its legal and political conclusions on the initiative, the action it intends to take, if any, and its reasons for taking or not taking action."

I can see your problem extremely clearly. You don't have any *inherent* respect for the individual. A nation wants to do what you want, and you respect them because they agree. A nation wants to defy your ideology, and you don't respect them.

Banana wars discussed in a famous English magazine: [https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2013/11/21/where-did-banana-republics-get-their-name](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2013/11/21/where-did-banana-republics-get-their-name)

Massive civilian killings during the Korean war, published by an American magazine: [https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/how-korean-war%E2%80%99s-brutality-turned-stomachs-america%E2%80%99s-most-hardened-soldiers-52237](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/how-korean-war%E2%80%99s-brutality-turned-stomachs-america%E2%80%99s-most-hardened-soldiers-52237)

The link between the CIA and the crack epidemic apparently was discovered and published not too long ago by a California newspaper.

I could go on but the point is deeper, look, you and I are neither historians nor investigative journalists. ""You have to know what you're looking for"" applies to learning more about any topic that isn't part of a school history curriculum. But the way you learned ""what to look for"" wasn't by getting hold of some classified footage, or by reading foreign history books that the US government doesn't allow importing, or reading some obscure university publication. It was by someone publishing it in the media in the hopes of reaching a wide audience (like all publishers do).

It is true that people ignore it in the sense of most people not giving a shit. But those people don't care about the history of other governments either. The key difference is that here you are allowed to know those things and you're allowed to tell them like with any other topic.  


&gt;China is not some censored hellworld, Chinese people themselves will tell you.

I've experienced the Great Firewall myself while visiting. And guides have explained to me the restrictions to install satellite TV antennas. Don't take my word for it, though, watch a Chinese filmographer asking Chinese people in Beijing: [https://vimeo.com/44078865](https://vimeo.com/44078865).

It doesn't matter if you want to call it hellworld or paradise, the fact of the matter is that just to be able and learn about certain topics, the Chinese have to first leave their country. While in your case you can just do a Google search and find things published by your fellow citizens to inform you of them. That's the difference I'm pointing out when comparing how ""both sides"" treat their government atrocities.

&gt;I've never liked how people emphasize COMMUNIST whenever they talk about China. How come no one ever says ""The capitalist regime of Nazi Germany/Fascist Italy/Russia/Brazil/India/etc""?

Well in the specific case of the sentence I wrote, it's because that level of censorship is not like something inherent to the nature of the Chinese themselves. It's inherent to authoritarian regimes like communism or fascism. So it felt weird not to specify that it wasn't ""a Chinese thing"".

On why people don't say ""the capitalist regime of Mussolini"" I would imagine it's because the fascist regimes in Europe were hardly capitalist; some explicitly rejecting capitalism."

* Bangladesh - major trade partners, Bangladesh buys tons of military gear
* Pakistan - Special relationship, a Chinese diplomat remarked that ""Pakistan is our Israel""
* Thailand - major trade partner, Thailand recently purchased tanks and submarines for $1 billion
* Mongolia - current president is pro China and Russia. Military cooperation, and China allows Mongolia to use one of its ports
* Russia - as recently as last year, Putin reiterated that Russia and China had a special relationship
* Uzbekistan - China is a huge partner in trade, and the Uzbek Prime Minister has called China Uzbekistan's ""Closest partner""

So whole China has made some enemies on the world stage, the assertion that they have no friends besides North Korea is absolutely false"

Fast forward to February 2020, the new governement in Khartoum is negotiating Al-Bachir's surrender to the ICC. Literally last week, one of his former generals who was also wanted by the Court was extradited to the Hague.

2020-06-20 22:44:08,DormiN96,"From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany

&gt; The Great Depression had spurred increased state ownership in most Western capitalist countries. This also took place in Germany during the last years of the Weimar Republic.[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany#cite_note-39) But after the Nazis took power, industries were privatized en masse. Several banks, shipyards, railway lines, shipping lines, welfare organizations, and more were privatized.[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany#cite_note-40) The Nazi government took the stance that enterprises should be in private hands wherever possible.[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany#cite_note-41) State ownership was to be avoided unless it was absolutely necessary for rearmament or the war effort, and even in those cases “the Reich often insisted on the inclusion in the contract of an option clause according to which the private firm operating the plant was entitled to purchase it.”[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany#cite_note-42) However, the privatization was ""applied within a framework of increasing control of the state over the whole economy through regulation and political interference,""[\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany#cite_note-43) as laid out in the 1933 Act for the Formation of Compulsory Cartels, which gave the government a role in regulating and controlling the cartels that had been earlier formed in the Weimar Republic under the Cartel Act of 1923.[\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany#cite_note-44) These had mostly regulated themselves from 1923 to 1933.[\[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany#cite_note-45)

They're definitely right wing on economic policies."
2020-06-20 22:43:36,CottageSamuel,"&gt; Are you trying to tell me the Nazis weren't an authoritarian right-wing ultranationalist ethnostate?

No, they were national socialists. So authoritarian left-wing ethnostate. They were globalists, in sense that entire globe should be wiped out clean to make space for germans. And yes, fascism was very strong with them.

&gt; Are you trying to tell me Mussolini's Italy wasn't authoritarian right-wing ultranationalists ethnostate?

Mussolini was proud socialist advocating for pretty much same thing as Stalin.

That was not true back when we were asked to whether we should enter EU or not. It was just an economic union back then. Now they are trying to impose a lot of ideological bs that we dont want to have anything to do with. And apparently Poles dont want either.

Fascism is capitalist reaction against socialist movements. The nazis even purged the ""socialist"" faction called strasserists. But even strasserism is not socialist. Right-wing ""anti-capitalism"" is not true anti-capitalism as it's based on a dislike for those who control it, in their belief it's the ""evil Jewish capitalists"" (as opposed ot the good and honorable aryan capitalist).

The really interesting thing is the fact that basically all Americans recognize basically everything you've listed as a bad thing and a regrettable part of our history. The big difference between us and China is that Americans realize this stuff and try to both personally be better and push our society and government to be better, and guess what we've succeeded, America is vastly better than it was when most of the stuff you listed happened (yes I realize some of it is modern) and is still trying to improve whereas most Chinese citizens aren't even aware of the things their government is doing and their government doesn't see any reason to change or improve because it thinks it can get away with the horrendous acts it keeps committing. Also of course people from China won't realize why their extreme censorship is bad because they've never experienced anything better that's just how it is for them. Also the reason people emphasize the Communist part of china and the Soviet Union is because it was/is a key point of their ideology and the reason they don't emphasize the capitalist part of the fascist governments the monarchies and the oppressive or extremely nationalistic states is because that was not a key part of their ideologies. Also many of the fascist World War Two powers were socialist.

Are you so selfish that you want to fuck over your own countries for some stupid city state on the other end of the world?

Chinese people do have freedoms. Do you really think over a billion people would put up with being oppressed? If the relatively small population of black people in America can bring about change when they put their efforts into it, do you think over a billion people wouldn't?

The US and China are incomparable when it comes to dealing with trials. In the US, the rich get off with no problems, white collar crimes are punished less severely than a homeless man stealing. In China billionaires are executed or sent to prison. 

How can you say that China would have shot Chelsea, when that's literally what the US did to Fred Hampton? In fact the goverment was also behind the assassinations of MLK and Malcolm X.

China is objectively not fascist. In fact Fidel Castro himself praised China as being socialist and praised Xi as a revolutionary leader. I'm no expert on China, but if a great leader like Fidel himself believes China to be socialist, I'm inclined to believe him.

Besides that, China actively trades with Cuba in opposition to the US embargo. Even if China wasn't socialist, even if their communism was just an aesthetic, China would still hold a principled anti-impeialist position."

It might work with the low tech industry, but that is where it pretty much stops. Look at all the roads, railways, infrastructure etc etc which is basically in tune with production in China. You'd need another 10-15 years to come even close to that level, and companies have to factor that in to stay competitive. The void created through the low tech industry moving will also be filled within moments, by other companies. Additionally, China is slowly turning its market away from manufacturing/producing towards a consumer market and simply won't need those leaving industries in the long run anymore.

2020-06-20 19:17:21,DCFY7439,"The RCMP Operations Manual requires officers handling confidential informants and agents to send reports to the director of the Covert Operations Branch at National Headquarters.

Headquarters’ media relations office said in an email Friday that Campbell’s statement that the force never had a “special relationship” with Wortman “still stands.”

The attorney general of Nova Scotia, former RCMP staff sergeant Mark Furey, has said the province is in talks with Ottawa about a joint federal-provincial inquiry or review of Wortman’s murderous rampage.

Furey’s office did not reply before deadline to a question about whether the terms of the inquiry would allow inquiry counsel to pierce the powerful legal privilege that attaches to confidential informants.

Family members of the victims have complained that the process is dragging out. As calls for an inquiry mount, so does speculation about what happened, among both the general public and the RCMP.

One former Mountie says he doesn’t understand why Wortman would turn against the Mounties if they were paying him. “What seems inconsistent to me is why are you going to bite the hand that feeds you? If he’s getting money, and that’s a lot of money for an agent, or a CI, that part doesn’t make sense to me.”

The former investigator pointed out that if Wortman was acting for the RCMP, and receiving that amount of money, he would eventually be expected to testify.

“If he was an agent, he should show up on a witness docket.”

But another Mountie says, “This guy always wanted to be a Mountie. He was acting like a Mountie. He was doing Mountie things. It’s clear to me that something went wrong.”"

2020-06-20 19:16:56,DCFY7439,"The withdrawal of $475,000 in cash by the man who killed 22 Nova Scotians in April matches the method the RCMP uses to send money to confidential informants and agents, sources say.

Gabriel Wortman, who is responsible for the largest mass killing in Canadian history, withdrew the money from a Brink’s depot in Dartmouth, N.S., on March 30, stashing a carryall filled with hundred-dollar bills in the trunk of his car.

According to a source close to the police investigation the money came from CIBC Intria, a subsidiary of the chartered bank that handles currency transactions.

Sources in both banking and the RCMP say the transaction is consistent with how the RCMP funnels money to its confidential informants and agents, and is not an option available to private banking customers.

The RCMP has repeatedly said that it had no “special relationship” with Wortman.

Court documents show Wortman owned a New Brunswick-registered company called Berkshire-Broman, the legal owner of two of his vehicles (including one of his police replica cars). Whatever the purpose of that company, there is no public evidence that it would have been able to move large quantities of cash. Wortman also ran his own denturist business and there is no reason to believe it also would require him to handle large amounts of cash.

If Wortman was an RCMP informant or agent, it could explain why the force appeared not to take action on complaints about his illegal guns and his assault on his common-law wife.

A Mountie familiar with the techniques used by the force in undercover operations, but not with the details of the investigation into the shooting, says Wortman could not have collected his own money from Brink’s as a private citizen.

“There’s no way a civilian can just make an arrangement like that,” he said in an interview.

He added that Wortman’s transaction is consistent with the Mountie’s experience in how the RCMP pays its assets. “I’ve worked a number of CI cases over the years and that’s how things go. All the payments are made in cash. To me that transaction alone proves he has a secret relationship with the force.”

A second Mountie, who does not know the first one but who has also been involved in CI operations, also believes that Wortman’s ability to withdraw a large sum of money from Brink’s is an indication that Wortman had a link with the police. “That’s tradecraft,” the Mountie said, explaining that by going through CIBC Intria, the RCMP could avoid typical banking scrutiny, as there are no holds placed on the money.

 “That’s what we do when we need flash money for a buy. We don’t keep stashes of money around the office. When we suddenly need a large sum of money to make a buy or something, that’s the route we take. I think \[with the Brink’s transaction\] you’ve proved with that single fact that he had a relationship with the police. He was either a CI or an agent.” 

A Canadian retail banking expert speaking on condition that they not be identified says it is unlikely that Wortman was cashing out his own savings when he collected the money from Brinks after the money was transferred from CIBC Intria.

“When you come into my branch and you want a ton of cash, then I say, you gotta give us a couple of days. We put in our Brink’s order, I order the money through Brink’s, then when the money arrives, you come back into the branch, I bring you into a back room and I count the money out for you,” the banking expert said. “Sending someone to Brink’s to get the money? I’ve never heard of that before. The reason is, if I’m the banker, and you’ve deposited your savings in my bank branch, I’m responsible for making sure the money goes to the right person. If you want this money, I’m going to verify your identity and document that. I can’t do that if I’m transferring the money to Brink’s.”

In response to detailed questions from *Maclean’s* about the transaction, a CIBC spokesperson replied via email: “Our hearts and thoughts are with the families and the entire community as they deal with this senseless tragedy and loss. Unfortunately we are not able to comment on specific client matters.” Brinks did not reply to questions about the transaction.

The banking expert speculates that the RCMP could keep transactions relatively quiet by going through Brink’s instead of a bank to transfer money to a confidential informant or an agent.

“You can imagine that if someone comes in with large sums of cash, that stuff is not kept quiet. You don’t want that. Maybe what the RCMP was doing is they thought they could keep things quieter simply by transferring funds via Brink’s.”

At a press briefing on June 4, Nova Scotia RCMP Superintendent Darren Campbell seemed to rule out the possibility that Wortman was a confidential informant for the force. “The gunman was never associated to the RCMP as a volunteer or auxiliary police officer, nor did the RCMP ever have any special relationship with the gunman of any kind.”

The RCMP Operations Manual, a copy of which was obtained by *Maclean’s*, authorizes the force to mislead all but the courts in order to conceal the identity of confidential informants and agent sources.

“The identity of a source must be protected at all times except when the administration of justice requires otherwise, i.e. a member cannot mislead a court in any proceeding in order to protect a source.”

A spokeswoman for the Nova Scotia RCMP declined further comment after *Maclean’s* reported on the financial transaction.

“This is still an active, ongoing investigation,” said Cpl. Jennifer Clarke in an email on Friday. “All investigative avenues and possibilities continue to be explored, analyzed, and processed with due diligence. This is to ensure that the integrity of the investigation is not compromised. We cannot release anything more related to your questions.”

*Maclean’s* [reported earlier this week](https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/the-nova-scotia-killer-had-ties-to-criminals-and-withdrew-a-huge-sum-of-cash-before-the-shooting/) that sources say Wortman had social relationships with Hells Angels, and with a neighbour, Peter Alan Griffon, who recently finished serving part of a seven-year sentence for drug and firearm offences linked to La Familia, a Mexican cartel. Sources say Griffon printed the decals that Wortman used on the replica RCMP cruiser he used in his rampage.

Sources say that RCMP in New Brunswick, not Nova Scotia, recently took over operational control of investigations into outlaw bikers in the Maritimes, which means that Nova Scotia Mounties may not have been aware of any connection to Wortman.

The RCMP Operations Manual identifies two types of sources: informant sources and agent sources. A law enforcement source said the force uses Brink’s to make large payments to agent sources, not informant sources.

“Informants are never paid more than a couple hundred at a time,” said a person briefed on RCMP operations. “Anything over $10,000 is agent money.”

Agents typically have greater responsibilities than informants. Only officers who have received specialized training are allowed to handle agents.

“An agent source is a person tasked by investigators to assist in the development of target operations,” says the manual. “Direct involvement and association with a target may result in his/her becoming a material and compellable witness, ie. a source used to introduce undercover operations, act as a courier for controlled delivers or act in place of an RCMP undercover operator by obtaining evidence.”

If the money was a transfer from the RCMP to an agent, there would be a paper trail through FINTRAC, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, which tracks large cash transactions and suspicious transactions.

“Brink’s does the FINTRAC paperwork saying it’s coming from us, it’s from a chartered bank, and the RCMP liaison at FINTRAC signs off, handles the paperwork,” said a source briefed on the system. “The RCMP guys clear it or they refer it for further investigation. They manually clear those FINTRAC reports coming from Brink’s related to paid agents.”"

America has lots of problems and has committed many egrigious sins, but literally genociding hundreds of thousands of Muslims in concentration camps is not one of them as far as I'm aware. As poor as America's geopolitical and human rights record is, China's is 100x worse, and that's only the stuff we know about.

Thing is, we Americans are allowed to talk about and debate our nation's atrocities and misdeeds. Look at what's happening right now: a very important national movement against police brutality and militarization. Whereas Chinese people are likely to be disappeared for saying ""Tiananmen 1989"" too often.

China as a society has little regard for human life and liberty. Hardly surprising when you're the world's most populous country; no one important will miss a few million Muslims, Tibetans, and other anti-CCP types.

""Death to AmeriKKKa?"" Go fuck yourself.

Better yet, move to China and disguise yourself as an Uighur in Xinjiang. See how long you last before you're either found out and deported or, better yet, whisked away into a camp.

P.S.: If you're a leftist (and some of your post suggests you might be), it's your *duty* to stand in opposition to China.

[[Image](https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euobs-media/b0c398db625a6ac9553465434ab1c113-800x.jpg)]: ^(Gay Pride rally in Warsaw in 2017. Polish government was ""instrumentalising hatred"", one MEP said (Photo: Lan Pham\))

The EU has threatened to cut pandemic-recovery funds to Polish regions on grounds of their gay-bashing declarations.

The thinly-veiled threat came in a recent letter from the European Commission, seen by EUobserver, to five Polish local governors who had declared their regions to be ""LGBTI-free"" zones.

The EU was currently deciding how to spend extra money to ""counter the coronavirus impact in Poland"", the letter said.

But, at the same time, the commission wanted the governors' ""assessment of the risk of discrimination"" in how the new funds would be allocated, for instance, to local businesses who refused to employ gay people.

It also urged the governors to adopt new ""measures promoting equality and non-discrimination"" in their regions and to confirm, in writing, what they planned to do.

The letter was signed by two top officials, Joost Korte and Marc Lemaître, who are also in charge of signing EU cheques to member states on social and regional projects.

They had seen complaints by Polish citizens on the ""increasing anti-LGBTI community rhetoric in Poland"", the officials noted.

They cited chapter and verse of EU law on Poland's obligations to protect minorities in their three-page letter.

""While at the same time they [Polish governors] are using EU funds ... these actions [LGBTI-free declarations] result in [some] citizens' fear of being discriminated [against] by these authorities, or being beaten by other citizens, or losing [their] jobs,"" Korte and Lemaître said.

And the problem reached the top of Polish politics, a group of pro-LGBTI MEPs also warned on Wednesday (17 June).

Polish president Andrzej Duda was guilty of ""instrumentalising hatred"" to try to win upcoming elections, Marc Angel, a left-wing MEP from Luxembourg said.

""It is unacceptable to have a president of a member state of the EU acting in complete violation of the treaties and the values on which the European Union is founded,"" independent Italian MEP Fabio Massimo Castaldo also said.

They spoke after Duda, on 10 June, adopted what he called a ""family charter"", which was to ""protect"" children from ""LGBTI ideology"" in schools.

Europe's pro-LGBTI values were ""more destructive"" than communism, Duda also told a campaign rally last weekend.

##New front
The commission letter opened a new front in the clash with Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, in a move which even surprised some other EU institutions, such as the Committee of the Regions in Brussels.

Korte and Lemaître's broadside came on top of previous EU sanctions threats and court injunctions designed to stop PiS from seizing control of Poland's judiciary.

It also came amid talk of slashing Poland's share of the next EU budget and amid doomsday speculation that if PiS kept Poland on the same trajectory, it might accidentally crash out of Europe, the same way the UK did.

For its part, PiS and Polish diplomats say the EU has no right to interfere in its domestic affairs.

But for Polish opposition leaders, such as former foreign minister Radek Sikorski, who is now an MEP, the PiS and its chairman, Jarosław Kaczyński, had a radically anti-European vision for the EU's sixth-largest member state.

""He [Kaczyński] wants to create a [Roman] Catholic state of the Polish nation. His vision is that of Salazar, or rather Franco,"" Sikorski recently told EUobserver, referring to António Salazar and Francisco Franco, two 1970s far-right dictators in Portugal and Spain."

2020-06-20 17:36:38,Langernama,"#Exclusive: European investors threaten Brazil divestment over deforestation
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Seven major European investment firms told Reuters they will divest from beef producers, grains traders and even government bonds in Brazil if they do not see progress in resolving the surging destruction of the Amazon rainforest.

The rising threats from investors with more than $2 trillion in assets under management, including Finland-based Nordea and the UK’s Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM), show how the private sector is taking global action to protect the world’s largest rainforest.

Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro has shrugged off diplomatic pressure on the matter.

Deforestation of Brazil’s Amazon surged to an 11-year high in 2019, Bolsonaro’s first year in office, and has risen a further 34% in the first five months of 2020, according to preliminary data from government space research agency INPE. The right-wing populist has weakened environmental protections and called for more mining and farming in the Amazon region.

“The trends we’ve seen in Brazil are very concerning,” said Daniela da Costa-Bulthuis, Brazil portfolio manager for Netherlands-based asset manager Robeco. “You have a dismantling of the regulatory mechanisms of environmental control since last year.”

Bolsonaro’s press office declined to comment on the investors’ concerns. He defended Brazil’s environmental record against criticism from world leaders last year as destructive fires in the Amazon drew global outcry. So far, corporate pressure has proven more effective in turning Brasilia’s attention to the environment.

A bill originally proposed by Bolsonaro to grant property deeds for irregularly settled public land, a measure seen encouraging deforestation, failed to reach a vote in May and is now delayed indefinitely after more than 40 mostly European companies threatened to boycott Brazilian exports.

##UNDER SCRUTINY
In September, 230 institutional investors signed a letter calling for urgent action to combat the fires surging in the Amazon rainforest, capturing global attention.

However, the seven asset management firms that spoke to Reuters - Storebrand, AP7, KLP, DNB Asset Management, Robeco, Nordea Asset Management and LGIM - went further in laying out the threat of divestment if there is not progress. The firms hold over $5 billion in investments linked to Brazil, including global grains traders with major operations in the country.

Norway’s largest pension fund KLP said it was engaging with trading firms Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) (ADM.N), Cargill and Bunge (BG.N) and judging if their environmental policies are adequate.

“If our conclusion is negative, divestment can be the likely result, potentially as soon as this year and we’d expect such a move to trigger other larger investors to follow our lead,” said Jeanett Bergan, KLP’s head of responsible investment, via email.

In response to questions on divestment, Bunge and Cargill described a range of efforts to root out deforestation from their supply chains, citing their adherence to the “Amazon Soy Moratorium.”

In that voluntary agreement, major trading firms including Cargill, Bunge and ADM pledged not to buy soy from parts of the Amazon deforested since 2008.

ADM did not respond to request for comment.

Norwegian insurance and pension provider Storebrand and Sweden’s largest national pension fund AP7 also said they could divest from ADM and Bunge if the companies do not take adequate measures to combat deforestation.

Norway’s DNB Asset Management AS said index funds it manages, which include holdings in Bunge, could exclude companies that fail to meet its sustainability standards.

Other investment firms mentioned concerns related to Brazilian meatpackers, which have drawn scrutiny in the past for sourcing beef from deforested areas of the Amazon.

LGIM is pushing Brazilian companies, including the world’s largest meatpacker, JBS (JBSS3.SA), and smaller rivals Marfrig (MRFG3.SA) and Minerva (BEEF3.SA) for “robust climate targets and land-use policies, with inaction potentially leading to voting sanctions and targeted divestments,” said Yasmine Svan, senior sustainability analyst at LGIM, in an emailed statement.

JBS, Minerva and Marfrig said in separate statements they are committed to eliminating Amazon deforestation from their supply chains and detailed their efforts.

##AFTER “QUARANTINE”
The asset management arm of Nordea (NDAFI.HE), one of the Nordic countries’ biggest banks, halted purchases of Brazilian sovereign debt last year after forest fires flared, putting its roughly 100 million euros ($112 million) of Brazilian government bonds in “quarantine.”

Thede Ruest, head of emerging-market debt at Nordea Asset Management, said the firm could go further.

“The next level of escalation from quarantining actually means selling our Brazil government bonds, which could trigger other funds following suit,” Ruest said. “We are disappointed by the lack of progress by the current administration, with deforestation rates continuing to soar ahead of another major fire season.”

Da Costa-Bulthuis of Robeco, which manages at least 3 billion euros in Brazilian equities and up to 5 billion euros when including debt and other assets, declined to comment on specific holdings.

But she said the firm could reduce its exposure to Brazil if its environmental record deteriorates further.

Da Costa-Bulthuis, along with LGIM’s Svan and Nordea’s Ruest, expressed alarm about a recent video of a Brazilian cabinet meeting, made public due to a federal investigation.

In the recording, Environment Minister Ricardo Salles suggested to Bolsonaro and other ministers that the government should accelerate environmental deregulation while the public is distracted by the current coronavirus pandemic.

“He’s working against the environment. What he said was unacceptable,” da Costa-Bulthuis said. “If they (the government) will be sensible or not, I think one way to start would be to change the environment minister because this guy does not have credibility.”

Salles and his press office did not respond to requests for comment on the statement. At the time, the minister said he was only calling for cutting unhelpful bureaucracy that hinders investment.

Bolsonaro dispatched the military last month to combat destruction of the Amazon, although deforestation rose again in May compared to a year earlier for the 13th straight month.

Da Costa-Bulthuis said that the deployment was “the minimum” the government could do and not an adequate replacement for strengthening agencies specialized in environmental enforcement.

“We don’t think they’re doing enough.”"

Anyway, US does have extreme cultural hegemony no doubt about that. But I made that comment regarding US success in bringing regime change in other countries. US used to have an extremely high success rates in plotting coup/ overthrowing governments/ invading and toppling governments etc. But US has been failing in that for last few years now. Their big mission is Iran for some time now. But they fear Iran because of all its proxy militias all throughout the middle east and US knows an invasion of Iran will not be only limited to Iran, it will spread all across middle east and US fears that. Now they are only relying on sanctions to bring in regime change. They have failed in Syria to overthrow Assad thanks to Russian and Iran. They have been losing their grip over Iraq for quite some time now. They have again failed in Venezuela to overthrow Maduro. US supported Saudi invasion in Yemen has also failed to defeat Houthis. US had a few successes in last decade to overthrow governments they don't like. But all their big projects failed. Although they can still sanction people to death, however I can see that losing its teeth too in the upcoming years. China has shown that it is willing to not abide by US sanctions. It has also given a chance to Iran and Venezuela to trade oil in Yuan. I know that US still has incredible influence and hegemony over geopolitics but with China &amp; Russia stepping up, I can see them losing it gradually."

Maybe if you watch American news and browse reddit, it won't seem like so, but think about the cultural dominance they have all over the world in movies, games, memes, social policy. Hell, we live in a world where Al-Qaeda receives an Oscar and Russians are painted as the ones pulling off the ""Highway of Death"" in games. Think of the might American policy has. They shake Europe and entities like Occupied Zone in Southern DPRK down for money to feed and house their troops. They sanction any country they want unilaterally and send it into poverty and starvation, causing unrest and hoping for regime change. This is happening in Venezuela, Cuba, Syria, Yemen, Iran and many other countries of the world. When someone tries to hold them accountable, like the ICC, they sanction them too and threaten arrest and downright invasion. We are alive and somewhat independent because we have nukes.

2020-06-20 16:01:51,mittro70_,"SRINAGAR: China on Saturday reiterated its claim over the strategic Galwan Valley and accused Indian troops of violating the agreement between Beijing and New Delhi by crossing the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh and attacking PLA troops when the situation was already easing.

Taking to Twitter, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lijian Zhao gave step-by-step account of the Galwan Valley incident in a series of eight posts.

In the [first Tweet](https://twitter.com/zlj517/status/1274187921621319680), Zhao claimed that the Galwan Valley is located on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control in the west section of the China-India boundary. For many years, he said the Chinese border troops have been patrolling and on duty in this region.

“Since April, the Indian border troops have unilaterally and continuously built roads, bridges and other facilities at the LAC in Galwan Valley. China lodged representations and protests on multiple occasions but India went even further to cross the LAC and made provocations,” Zhao said in his second Tweet.

In another Tweet, the spokesperson alleged, “On May 6, Indian border troops crossed LAC, trespassed into China’s territory, built fortification &amp; barricades, which impeded the patrol of Chinese border troops. They deliberately made provocations in an attempt to unilaterally change the status quo of control &amp; management,”

Zhao said that the Chinese border troops were compelled to take necessary measures to respond to the situation on the ground and strengthen management &amp; control in the border areas. “To ease the situation, China and India stayed in close communication through military and diplomatic channels,” he said.

In the following Tweet, he added that in response to the strong demand of the Chinese side, India agreed to withdraw the personnel who crossed the LAC and demolish the facilities, and so they did.

Referring to the high-level army commanders meet on June 6, Zhao said that India promised it would not cross the estuary of Galwan river to patrol &amp; build facilities. He said that the two sides would discuss &amp; decide phased withdrawal of troops by officials on the ground.

“Shockingly, on the evening of June 15, India’s front-line troops, in violation of the agreement reached at the commander-level meeting, once again crossed the Line of Actual Control for deliberate provocation when the situation in the Galwan Valley was already easing,” he claimed.

In his last Tweet, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson alleged, “India’s front-line troops even violently attacked the Chinese officers and soldiers who went there for negotiation, thus triggering fierce physical conflicts and causing casualties.  This is the step-by-step account of the Galwan clash”.

Zhao’s reaction comes in the backdrop of allegations and counter-allegations by New Delhi and Beijing over the deadly clash that has brought the two neighbouring nations to the brink of war.

On Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told an all-party meet that the soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice taught a “lesson” to those who had dared to look towards India and that the army has been given “freedom” to take necessary steps.

The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long LAC.

Prior to the clashes, both sides have been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it is necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas."

\&gt;  This is already happening, though.

Their leverage has helped protect their humanitarian issues for a long time like with the Uighurs. The only reason countries are changing now is because of border conflicts or breaking treaties. Concentration Camps would be a pretty good topic for the UN to challenge China about (get to that in a minute), but because China is running a MAD-style threat, other countries are just turning a blind eye to whatever China do to their own citizens

\&gt; See: Australia

That's where MAD fails. Australia didn't budge in a deal with China, China took the first step and started the cyber attack. Now they're actually targeting Australia, clearly Australia would rather just back out without trying to agitate them further (which is why they haven't named the cyber attack state), and other countries would rather get out before the same happens to them

\&gt; Nobody cares about the UN anymore

\&gt; The UN does not have that power

The UN doesn't have much influence but that'd be the first place to raise humanitarian concerns. That wouldn't matter anyway, because if the UN even tried China would threaten or just veto any talks about how they're treating protesters/Uighurs. Of course vetoed decisions by the UN can't affect the individual decisions of countries, but if they somehow had talks that aren't killed in the first steps, it's pretty likely Countries would consider tighter sanctions against them.

Also pretty much all of that strategy is for the most part past tense. Seems to be coming down pretty quickly but given how aggressive they are to get their way, it'll probably end messy."

2020-06-20 15:29:29,Squirrelsquirrelnuts,"It doesn’t matter if India is still close to Russia. Practical thinking often prevails in these types of specific situations. The one camp vs another camp type of mentality does not dominate everywhere. 

The Iraqi government has been very pro-Iran since 2005, but it didn’t the US giving them weapons and training their troops. Similarly Russia doesn’t mind India being militarily super friendly to Israel, even though Russia is the biggest sponsor of factions acting against the Israeli-Saudi Middle Eastern new order. There are so many examples like this. 

Russo-Chinese relations is not a simple friend or foe type of situation either. In some areas, cooperation with China benefit Russia more, while in others containing China may be the better option. Russia is now outspent in military by countries like France, and its relative military strength will only go lower. Russia needs every bit of advantage to keep its status as a major military power as long as possible. 

On North Korea, Russia coordinates with China very closely. By doing this they tie down a lot of American assets to the Far East, while (more importantly) remain a secondary actor behind China in the region to save Russia’s own assets to be used elsewhere. 

In South Asia, supporting India helps Russia redirect China’s resources and keeps the the Chinese border empty, which achieves the same goal as supporting China on North Korea i.e. save military resources elsewhere to concentrate on European Russia. 

China’s military power will grow, but that growth will mostly used in regions that Russia have very little presence in, like South East Asia. The dynamics between Russia and China in regions they have been dealing with each other won’t change for some time."

Nothing impressive about it. It was just ""World, the population of China is for sale cheap! We undercut the labor prices of the rest of the world and we will 100% side with foreigners (because fuck our own people) in any disputes."" The CCP never saw the Chinese people as anything other than a tool for the CCP to use to gain power. 

&gt;Gain industrial-scale leverage on pretty much every Country

China's ""leverage"" is not turning out to be as powerful as they believed it would be. See: Australia.

&gt;Expand that leverage into the UN

Nobody cares about the UN anymore. It's a joke that lost all relevance with the end of the cold war.

&gt;Other countries aren't going to touch them for fear of gutting trade deals/breaking mass production process

This is already happening, though. 

&gt;Even if they try, use the UN influence to veto it

The UN does not have that power. lol"

China even has a ton more inhabitants than the west, especially compared to the USSR. So, whereas the USSR had a limit on how economically powerful they could get, compared to the west that has 3-4 times the population, even if they adopted full fledged capitalism, China has around 2 times the population of the west, they would be way less susceptible to embargos.

China basically played this perfectly, I feel. Correct me if I'm wrong, but only the one-child policy is a play that could hurt them in the future when their population gets older"

2020-06-20 13:52:18,alexinternational,"ICJ only deals with states ***only*** as parties to a dispute and can adjudicate matters basically only if:

* a) states explicitly agree to it and recognize the ICJ as the adjudicating body in the matter at hand

* b) the states involved made a prior universal declaration that they recognizes the jurisdiction of the ICJ in areas that include the matter at hand

* c) the treaty relevant to the matter at hand has a specific clause that makes the ICJ the dispute-resolution mechanism

Otherwise it can provide an advisory opinion.

The ICC deals with trial and persecution of ***individuals*** that have allegedly committed ***international crimes*** (many different definitions but mostly includes genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and crimes of aggression). Like with ICJ, *states* can bring a case to the court, but unlike ICJ, so can the  ICC's ***own prosecutors***, under certain circumstances and if they deem it necessary (like states' own judicial systems failing to bring justice). Another important difference is that the ICJ is universal in the sense that its provisions as described are valid for every state current or future ones, whereas the ICC is ***territorial***. ICC can persecute individuals ***only*** if they commited one of the before mentioned crimes either ***on the territory*** of a signatory country (member of the ICC) or if the said individual is the ***signatory country's citizen***."

That article also says 300 Chinese soldiers with improvised weapons attacked 55 apparently unarmed Indian soldiers while India suffered only 20 deaths but China suffer 43 deaths.

2020-06-20 09:29:35,hyperbolicplain,"True. One problem is that China, having stictly state controlled media and being an extremely authoritarian and autocratic state, has to spend so much time spinning their propaganda to placate their own citizens it has very negative consequences when viewed by the rest of the world, which they don't even bother adjusting their narrative for. This feeds the McCarthyist thinking of average people against China. 

China doesn't even bother allaying peoples worst fears as long as they are not Chinese citizens, so to some extent they are the ones feeding the anti-china rhetoric. A big part of that tragedy is that people get really bad confirmation bias and forget to do even basic fact checking or due dilligence when interpreting news articles about China.

Lets not kid ourselves that the CCP are blameless angels on the world stage though. They are getting extremely bellicose and openly expansionist right now and I think it is something that needs to be closely reported on.

&gt; To China&amp;#039;s Communist party, military victory meant that India and China would soon be friends.

&gt; With the use of the Chinese military against a neighbour for the first time in the 21st century, Xi Jinping is testing the limits not only of India, but of the world&amp;#039;s response to China&amp;#039;s rise to power.

&gt; Whether it is issuing threats to Britain over Huawei and critical infrastructure projects, punishing Australia through curtailed beef imports over calls for an inquiry into the origins of Covid-19 or sinking Vietnamese fishing trawlers in the South China Sea, China has made it clear to many nations that it is ready to push hard to have its way.

&gt; The EU has demanded the immediate release of a Chinese human rights lawyer sentenced to four years in jail, saying his right to a fair trial was not respected.

&gt; &amp;quot;The European Union expects China to ensure full respect of the rule of law, to establish fair trial guarantees and to investigate thoroughly all reported cases of arbitrary detentions, ill-treatment and torture of human rights defenders and their families,&amp;quot; the spokesperson said in a statement.

&gt; The case will add to EU-Chinese tensions just days before a major EU-China summit, with relations already on edge over a host of disputes from trade issues to security and human rights.

But I can give you vague answers. A country produces what it produces. A tautology, sure. That's the GDP. But *citizens*, and *allied nations* believe in the nation as a producer of... whatever. The payoff for anybody involved will range from months, years, decades. They knew that going in. It's not like having a credit card. Nobody will come knocking on a countries door, but if nobody thinks you can pay your debts, nobody will ever help you. If you're a productive and efficient nation, having debt is a good thing. That means you got help to make your nation even greater. 

You can think of it like a company. A brand new company struggles to make money, if any at all. They have to convince people that they will make money, so people invest. That's kind of a debt. The people who believe in a new company either never recover their money, or they profit. 

A countries debt works similarly, but the timescales are way longer. Years, even decades. If a country is accepting too much help (too much debt), and not producing enough, everyone gets worried. On the other hand, if other nations give you tons of money (tons of debt), and you spin that money into creating tons of stuff (GDP) or it expands your military, or has some geopolitical benefit, then all the nations have a high opinion of you and are willing to fund you in the future.

Don't take this as gospel. I have no idea what I'm talking about, but I hope maybe it helps you understand vaguely the forces at play."

2020-06-20 06:52:06,weebAnnihilator,"I am not pressuring India all I’m saying is what I would do or what I think they should do if I was in their position. It’s not in any individual countries favor to strongly unite against China because of how much that costs. This isn’t a playground bully situation, where you just got to all band together merrily and say “stop China!” and all is well. This shit is more complicated than just projecting strength, there is a reason no one wants to fight China and it’s because it’s costly. Threatening war on their soil sounds all nice and mighty on a Reddit post, same thing with me just saying “negotiate for peace”. But at the end of the day it’s more nuanced than that, China’s view of itself going from the country taken advantage of by the west to the country taking advantage of others, the ripples in trade/commerce from being at war with China one of the largest manufacturers of cheap labor, the resources they possess, for example rare earth metals, the fact that there are nuclear missiles involved, the difficulty in rallying many different countries with different agendas together for the purpose of standing against China, there are so many facets that are affected, and many of them extend beyond China itself. It benefits corporations to use China for exploitative and cheap labor, as horrible as it is, as long as these corporations also have power we have an issue. Tackling China isn’t so easy, but look what you have in your hands, as India. You have the ability to keep peace or to pursue war. Obviously you don’t have to just bend the knee, but boiling down negotiations and politics to puffing your chest and looking strong is kind of shallow. I guess at the end of the day, each country will act in their own self interest, and if India does or doesn’t want war just depends on how they weigh their own priorities, which I guess I don’t know. But either way it’s in their and China’s hands. China also doesn’t want to engage in a war where their people don’t support them so if they don’t get a favorable position then they won’t pursue."

2020-06-20 05:28:31,TheMania,"It's actually far easier than that to understand MMT, there's many different ways I can dress it.

The one I think you might find helps is :-

---

Old way of funding a deficit: print financial assets to the value of the deficit, sell them at auction, use the money raised. These assets have the govt's name on them, they trade for near the value on their face.

MMT suggests: skip the middle man step, and print financial assets to the value of the deficit, use them to directly pay for the deficit. Put the bank of England's name on them (or more realistically, just change reserves in the computer systems that track ious).

Both ways, you print the same value of assets. Both ways, the non govt receives the full value of the deficit as a surplus. The difficult thing is trying to explain why anyone thinks MMT is wrong here, and traditionally requires pointing to a flawed model of banking which ultimately comes down to ""because banks multiply reserves but they don't multiply gilts *for some reason*"".

---

The other is to simply consider that the govt is nominally risk free to lend to, and as such, is always assured the lowest interest rates attainable. The CB ensures banks are loaning to one another, and so therefore, the govt can borrow money to.

If you set your own credit limit, and your mates sets a limit on what you'll be charged on it - lower than anyone else in the economy - why bother pretending that you have to pay anything back at a time that is inconvenient for you?

Ergo, whilst MMT will say you should cut out the middle man to reduce the overhead and obfuscation of the system, both approaches are actually sustainable. Enjoy."
2020-06-20 05:21:52,TheMania,"Considering the govt is nominally risk free to lend to, it always gets the lowest interest rates attainable in the currency it chooses to borrow.

The central bank ensures interest rates stay low until raising them will not harm the economy, and the govt should treat paying it back in the same way. You don't run a surplus if doing so is going to force people out of work, that's just bad policy, like austerity before it. Those that push for it do not understand the freedom that currency issuing nations have."

2020-06-20 04:59:27,Renathras,"&gt; But telling the bully to deescalate doesn’t do anything, what’s stopping them from just punching you in the face anyway?

You punching them in the face.

That's the simple answer.

If a bully keeps punching you as you have your hands up and are talking to them trying to talk them into stopping, you punching them in the face hard enough to take them down is what will stop them.

Condemning China doesn't generally work because much of the world community dithers.  They say ""The US is just as bad"" or they issue some half-hearted, slap on the wrist sanctions.

The world community standing together saying ""NO!  China, stop it or we will ALL crush you with sanctions destroying your economy and if that doesn't work, war on your soil.""

Yeah, China's big on saving face and would resent that, but it's the one thing that would stop them:

Their power is entirely based on the global economy and them being a net exporter to it.  SERIOUSLY threaten that and China has to fold.  They could try to be more belligerent, but China vs THE ENTIRE WORLD doesn't end in China's favor.  And even China's leadership knows their limits.

They keep pushing because there aren't any.

But notice how when the US sends a warship into the strait of Taiwan, China doesn't go out there and stop them.  Because China knows when they're staring down an enemy they can't (yet) defeat.

They can't (yet, or likely ever) defeat the world community as a whole.

The problem is, the world community AS A WHOLE refuses to directly and credibly threaten China, so China carries on as if the world community is implicitly allowing their actions.

.

By pressuring India instead of China, you are implicitly saying that China isn't the bad guy.  At BEST, you're saying India and China are equally bad, which is saying China isn't the bad guy.  At worst, you're having India bow to China, cup in hand, begging for deescalation, which makes China the superior/dominant.

While the modern Western mindset is ""But this gets us peace, right?  Isn't that good?""

...the problem is, it reinforces China's view of it BEING the dom, and in so doing, empowers and emboldens them to do more next time, as they know not only will they NOT face consequences, they can preen from one high, looking down their nose as the enemies THEY attack come crawling on hands and knees to prostrate before them and beg for peace.

OP the caste system was slowly becoming obsolete during the Mughal era as neither the muslims, upper caste or lower last Hindus wanted it and strive to dismantle it.  However the bulk of India is middle caste Hindus and they're of the same kind of people like white middle class Americans from middle America.  They not really socially progressive don't want to see any part of their old culture gone.  The British didn't specifically added to the caste system, but they prevented the former Indians from dismantling it as means to win support from the middle caste Hindus, who were the majority of the population.  It's the same as in America when Republicans pander to the Evangelist about passing laws against abortions &amp; gays because they'll get those people to support them."

That would shift the balance of power quite significantly to the Indian side, which is why China is so concerned about.

2020-06-20 04:14:08,Renathras,"&gt; Relative magnitudes.

The problem is, if there are no consequences, or relatively mild consequences (moderate economic sanctions that don't REALLY crush the nation's economy), then bad actor nations will continue to do what they do.  Until they are confronted, you run into appeasement.

It has been less than a century since ""Peace in our time"" led to the most massive global war and loss of life in Human history.  Surely we have not forgotten the danger of doing so - especially in a nuclear world..?

&gt; Ad hominem

Ad hominem, as a fallacy, is to discount an argument based on the person saying it.  That is, to find fault with the person saying it to escape having to address the argument.

If you're treating words coming from a nation-state as a premise/argument to address, and you define those words as coming from said nation-state - which you implicitly are when you say words to the effect of ""The US isn't one to talk..."" - then the attempt is to discard the argument based on an attack of the entity making said argument, or ""shoot the messenger"".

Hence why I say a person can be a torture murderer but CAN still say ""X is wrong"" and X be wrong.  That is, an evil person CAN be right about things.

...and that's assuming we were to agree that the US is the absolute worst of the worst (I would say torture and murder are pretty solidly evil - rape is on the same level as torture); something that isn't really a good assumption.

While the US does a lot of bad, it does a lot of good as well.  So me framing this as ""if even the worst person said X is bad, it can be they're right"" could be amended to include ""...much less if a somewhat 'normalish' person said it."""

In making the two sides equivalent (in their need to do something), you excuse the bully (in the BULLY'S mind, you aren't condemning them, so IN THEIR MIND - because this is how bullies think - they can keep doing what they're doing since you aren't specifically calling them out), which then emboldens the bully to do more.

Also, since I'm an airplane nerd, I have to comment on number 3. The F-22 wasn't exported to Japan because Congress literally said that it couldn't be exported to ANYONE. This was back when the US had a monopoly on stealth aircraft. If the US was so concerned about information leaking to China, then the F-35 wouldn't have been exported either. The F-35 is in some ways even more capable than the F-22 as it is a multirole platform with JSDMF versions being able to take off and land from their helicopter destroyers.

EDIT: I should note a difference as well is that the US does not TARGET civilian populations.  While it is true that they are harmed in the crossfire and proximity, they are never the targets.

YES, I know that doesn't make them less dead.  But a person hitting a civilian when firing into a crowd at a bad guy, aiming at the bad guy and hitting the civilian unintentionally is VERY different than a person aiming AT civilians shooting them wantonly.

But keep being an apologist to China.  I'd wager within 20 years, 50 tops, the US will have gone the way of the USSR and China will be the dominant power in the East, and probably the World.

If you're not much older than I am (or if you're younger), we will likely both live to see the day where you get to rue your words and your making excuses for the worst major power nation in the world.

Not that it will be much comfort, but you will likely live long enough to see the evil you and those like you, in excusing and whataboutism, engender."

2020-06-20 03:52:45,dekachin5,"&gt; Russia gains way more from selling to China though.

China has openly said that it doesn't plan to buy any future fighters from Russia. China openly tries to steal IP from and reverse engineer everything it buys from Russia, and China's end game is clearly to catch up to and surpass Russia then compete with it and steal Russia's international arms sales. 

So no, Russia doesn't gain more from selling to China, and Russia's arms sales to China are complicated and stalled for years because both sides haggle where China tries to buy small amounts (if China could buy 1 copy, it would, because all China really wants is to reverse engineer and steal IP).

&gt;But if India does start partnering with the US and buying us arms, I wonder how integration will work between future and existing weapons.

There's no reason to think India would bother buying US arms since India's military doctrine isn't based on US principles, and US military hardware is a lot more expensive. The reason that US allies tend to need US hardware is that US doctrine relies on squeezing out the most qualitative superiority possible. Russian military equipment is more designed for quantity over quality."

&gt;Turkey got the F-35 taken away for buying S400s from Russia. 

1. Turkey has been a cunt to the US in a lot of ways in recent history, not just that. As an American, I view Turkey as being only a few steps removed from Iran politically. 

2. It's common sense for the US government to withhold the latest technology from countries of questionable loyalty because they would just turn around and give that tech to Russia or China. The US taxpayer doesn't spend hundreds of billions of dollars to develop a technological edge just to have that given away. 

3. Japan wanted the F-22 and we said no. Japan is a great ally to the US, but we didn't trust that Japan would do a good enough job of protecting the F-22s secrets from China."

Long term dept is a nations bread and butter, pay off the interest until inflation does its job and the dept is small enough to pay off in one go. That being said if your national dept gets too high then bonds become less desirable and harm the value of the dept. Bond markets are down so Britain is probably going to eat into other places (welfare, education, Barnet, military etc) to pay for it except this time there isn’t room in budgets to make austerity a viable option."

It was only after Mao gotten hold over the entirety of Mainland China did he annex Tibet. Tibet was annexed for pretty much geo-political reasons, if they did not take over it now, Britain would take over, atleast in the form of puppet politicians.

Moreover, most the main river-ways that feed China all have their origins at Tibet, so to just leave Tibet as is would have been a long way to suffocation for Mao, and hence he really had no practical choice when it comes to annexation."
2020-06-20 02:46:45,Speed_of_Night,"It can be bad if who they are paying them to is not productive in a way we want it to be. For example: many countries have public pension plans, in The United States, the largest is Social Security. When we pay out Social Security, we are paying off a debt we have made to our senior citizens, with this money they will then go on to buy whatever they buy in retirement, which is an inflationary pressure on those goods, and, in turn, you have a happier citizen. If Social Security pays some old guy, and then that old guy goes out and buys waffles, was that a good thing? A supply chain has to be set up and managed by people and consume resources to make those waffles. Multiply that by 1,000,000 senior citizens buying waffles and you have a company or series of companies employing people to make waffles for senior citizens on a regular basis, which means that those people won't be employed making something else, like, say, watches. Is this a GOOD thing? Should we spend resources on waffles or watches? Well, if you think that it is a good thing for seniors to be able to retire and eat, more than something more frivolous that you could spend that money on, such as a watch, then yes, that is a good thing.

&amp;#x200B;

A problem CAN arise if you make too many indebted concessions to some people over another, where you start doing things for people that you shouldn't be doing. Maybe say, the government buys a bunch of missiles that it shouldn't be, and it directs national resources to making and transporting missiles. That is bad. Both of these things use debt, obligation, to make happen. So debt is basically a neutral term, because debt is merely obligation, what you are obligating someone to do is what is important."

We currently live in a society of extremely low interest rates, and, since people are still buying those bonds, countries are justified in continuing to sell them. A net 1% interest rate in a country whose national debt is 200% of its GDP is functionally equivalent to a net 2% interest rate in a country whose national debt is 100% of its GDP.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing to consider is central bank independence. with Japan, for example, they have one of the highest debt to GDP ratios of any wealthy country, but they can maintain this because their equivalent of the treasury and FED are both government run, so Their Treasury can print negative interest rate Treasuries and their FED can buy them with complete impunity. It's basically just printing money with no immediate accountability from its private sector, but it's private sector doesn't really care, because, in spite of all of their money printing, their overall fiscal and monetary policy still maintains either deflation or extremely low inflation. If that changed, then their citizens might revolt against their irresponsible activity, but, right now, their actions are effectively not irresponsible, because they are within the margin or error for good/bad monetary and fiscal policy outcomes."

Money is only created when the government literally spends it into existence.

If you analyse any modern economic system, you can pretty clearly see that government spending happens before taxes are collected and that in every healthy economy, spending always outstrips revenue."

I get it, you don't want megacorporations to step on the working class. You want better help for the downtrodden. You want an ascent above separation and to unite the world, but that isn't going to work without capitalism.

2020-06-19 21:57:05,x1rom,That is another misconception. Socialism and Democracy aren't exclusive. The most popular socialist ideology today is democratic socialism. The core to democracy is that every single human is as valuable as the next. That means everyone has the exact same amount of votes in most cases. Which is actually contradictory to capitalism which values rich people more and conservatism seeks justification for these injustices. Most modern societies accept this contradiction and try to work around it. But this leads to other problems.

&gt; ""While we all need to have a balanced budget because debt is bad for us, the same isn’t true for a nation’s budget. Deficits can be useful for a country’s economy. *Deficit spending achieved by cutting taxes or by the purchase of goods and services by the government can help the economy.*""

[Second source](https://www.investopedia.com/updates/usa-national-debt/)

&gt; ""From a public policy standpoint, the issuance of debt is typically accepted by the public, so long as the proceeds are used to stimulate the growth of the economy in a manner that will lead to the country's long-term prosperity. However, when debt is raised simply to fund public consumption—such as proceeds used for Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid—the use of debt loses a significant amount of support. *When debt is used to fund economic expansion, current and future generations stand to reap the rewards.* However, debt used to fuel consumption only presents advantages to the current generation.""

[Same source, different article](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/10/sovereign-debt-default.asp)

&gt; ""Before buying a government's sovereign debt, investors determine the risk of the investment. *The debt of some countries, such as the United States, is generally considered risk free*, while the debt of emerging or developing countries carries greater risk.""

&gt; ""Developing countries can be at a disadvantage when it comes to borrowing funds. Like investors with poor credit, developing countries must pay higher interest rates and issue debt in foreign stronger currencies to offset the additional risk assumed by the investor. * Most countries, however, don't run into repayment problems*.""

[fucking WIKIPEDIA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt)

&gt; ""*In a monetarily sovereign country such as the United States of America, the United Kingdom and most other countries, government debt held in the home currency are merely savings accounts held at the central bank.* In this way this ""debt"" has a very different meaning to the debt acquired by households who are restricted by their income. Monetarily sovereign governments issue their own currencies and do not need this income to finance spending.""

&gt;""Although a national government may choose to default for political reasons, *lending to a national government in the country's own sovereign currency is generally considered ""risk free*"" and is done at a so-called ""risk-free interest rate"". This is because the debt and interest can be repaid by raising tax receipts (either by economic growth or raising tax revenue), a reduction in spending, or by creating more money.""

2020-06-19 21:25:49,DCFY7439,"&gt;Currently the president's party has the majority in both the Congress and the Senate, and most of his initiatives are approved without discussing them that much. The ""leaked"" document talks about an strategy to create a counterweight on the Senate and Congress, by winning enough places in the Congress / Senate in the following midterm elections. **This is not overthrowing.** 

I agree with you here. There is no plan of overthrowing in the document. The headline is clearly a hyperbole. However, if foreign powers particularly the US get involved, you can classify that as foreign meddling and in some cases that does lead to overthrow or coup.

&gt;The ""strategy"" in the leaked document lists some known center-right and right-wing figures (media influencers and members of the opposing parties) wich curiously are adversaries of the current president and the party he created.   
&gt;  
&gt;This is why there are widespread suspicions here in Mexico about this ""leak"" being a fabrication by government itself to distract media about the bad managament of the COVID-19 pandemic here in the country (among a lot of other stuff the gov is doing wrong here). It's not the first time the presient tries to distract media by releasing something like this. 

Yeah. This is very much a possibility. Creating distraction by creating an enemy in either home or abroad is not a new tactic used in politics. It is very likely he is doing this to rile up his base. I also don't want to discount the possibility of this document being authentic. Honestly, I found their strategies very pragmatic. US and current Mexico administration clearly don't see eye to eye in some issues. Involving US in Mexican politics by raising those points sound like something an opposition bloc would want to do. Also, their other political strategies also sound believable to me. I assume you are from Mexico, so you would know better than me. I would be interested in following Mexican politics closely to see whether some bloc like this really emerges or this is just pure fantasy."

I agree with you here. However, that's how most of the US meddling starts. An opposition party/block who wants to beat/overthrow the current government asks US to help/support them and promise US to be more helpful than the current government.  

&gt;All things considered, isn't this just a strategy to defeat the incumbent party in the next election? 

Yeah, I agree with this too. I think the impeachment thing is probably the only red flag here. But, it is still a democratic process.

2020-06-19 21:06:26,vargo17,"It depends on what school of monetary theory you try to analyze it in. Currently, there are two prevailing theories. 

1. Fiat currencies behave in a similar manner to currencies backed by precious metals. (Inflation is directly related to the amount of money a government adds to an economy)

This acts like a soft limit in how many dollars you can add. Since there is a limit to what you can add, the % of the budget that goes to pay interest on the debt directly blocks government spending on other goods and services. Under this theory, the only way to reduce the debt is to grow the economy or raise taxes. (Both lead to increased tax revenue).

2. A new theory is being pushed, (driven by the last decade or so where inflation seems to be divorced from the actions of central banks), to oversimplify it that money has stopped acting as representational currency and seems to be behaving as a commodity. And as such central banks can print money so long there is demand for the currency. And inflation serves as a key sign that demand has been met.

Under this one, there's no reason to worry about debt because a country should print money until inflation sets in.

Tl; DR Too much debt can reduce how much a government can spend on other things, but some people think we could be a lot looser with money and debt levels can go significantly higher before issues show up."

&gt; BRASILIA - Seven major European investment firms told Reuters they will divest from beef producers, grains traders and even government bonds in Brazil if they do not see progress in resolving the surging destruction of the Amazon rainforest.

&gt; Deforestation of Brazil&amp;#039;s Amazon surged to an 11-year high in 2019, Bolsonaro&amp;#039;s first year in office, and has risen a further 34% in the first five months of 2020, according to preliminary data from government space research agency INPE. The right-wing populist has weakened environmental protections and called for more mining and farming in the Amazon region.

&gt; &amp;quot;The trends we&amp;#039;ve seen in Brazil are very concerning,&amp;quot; said Daniela da Costa-Bulthuis, Brazil portfolio manager for Netherlands-based asset manager Robeco.

2020-06-19 20:39:16,mittro70_,"**New Delhi**: After amending the Constitution to adopt the controversial new political map on its national emblem, Nepal has now decided to establish an army barrack near Kalapani and open a road there for easy access, signalling a further deterioration of ties between New Delhi and Kathmandu.

The new map shows three disputed areas of Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh as part of Nepal.

Nepal’s move coincides with India’s month-long face-off with China that resulted in a major clash at the Galwan River valley in Ladakh Monday in which [20 Indian soldiers](https://theprint.in/defence/at-least-20-indian-soldiers-dead-after-ladakh-clash-with-china-soldiers/442945/) were killed while many were left severely injured.

On Wednesday, Nepal Army Chief General Purna Chandra Thapa had visited the Kalapani border area.

“We are going to establish an army barrack near the border. Now there is no direct road access. So army is given duty to open track. And, we have established BOP (border outpost of Armed Police Force) in Chhangru, near Kalapani,” Bishnu Rijal, deputy chief of the department of foreign affairs &amp; member of the Central Committee, Nepal Communist Party (NCP) told ThePrint from Kathamandu.

This comes a day after Nepal’s upper house of Parliament [passed the Constitutional Amendment bill](https://theprint.in/world/nepal-parliament-unanimously-votes-for-constitutional-amendment-to-redraw-map/444006/) to change its map, and President Bidya Devi Bhandari ratified it the same day. Nepal’s lower house had passed the bill last week.

Sources said India is “infuriated” that Nepal has now gone a step further and decided to station security forces in region, which New Delhi considers to be a “disputed” region between the two.

Official sources said, Oli is doing all this to “further his political agenda”, and he is using the new map as a “tool for political gains”. This, despite Kathmandu contuining to accuse India of not talking with the government there to settle the matter diplomatically.

Last week, Oli had [also accused India](https://theprint.in/diplomacy/oli-now-says-india-has-encroached-nepals-territory-since-1962-should-return-it/439344/) of “encroaching” on its territory since 1962 by stationing its Army in the Kalapani region. “Our territory should be returned,” Oli said a day after his government tabled a bill in the House of Representatives, the lower house of parliament, to amend Nepal’s Constitution to include the disputed regions of Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh and Kalapani in its official map.

#China-Nepal video-conference on leadership

Meanwhile, the Communist Party of China (CPC) held two virtual meetings with the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) on Belt and Road Initiative and also on developing leadership skills, diplomatic sources said.

“The High-level Video Conference on Belt and Road International Cooperation was successfully held yesterday! Hon. @PradeepgyawaliK Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nepal also delivered important speech on the occasion. Congrats!,” Hou Yanqi, Chinese Ambassador to Nepal stated [in a tweet](https://twitter.com/PRCAmbNepal/status/1273892920207134720).

A similar symposium was also [held last year](https://theprint.in/opinion/xi-jinping-embrace-of-nepal-bad-news-for-modi-neighbourhood-first-policy/307098/) before Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit there, the first Chinese head of state to undertake a trip to Nepal after a gap of 23 years.

However, today’s workshop comes at a time when tensions between India and China are at its peak and ties between India and Nepal are at an all-time low."

2020-06-19 19:47:10,x1rom,"Perhaps this was worded a bit badly, that's why you're getting downvoted.

The general reasoning to this logic is that fascism is inherently hirarchical. A lot of ideologies are very hirarchical, but fascism is unique in the sense that the justification for the hirarchy is nationalities or races. Another unique property of fascism or just the extreme right is that on its own, it often doesn't amass enough supporters, and often hijacks other systems. And the way a society becomes fascist is also irrelevant. In Italy it was a coup, in Germany a bit of democratic trickery, in Japan a military takeover, where the government lost control over the army.

The thing is: capitalism and especially conservatism is very susceptible to fascist takeover. Because lassez faire capitalism given enough time leads to an entrenched hirarchy. And conservatism seeks justification for this hirarchy. The core to conservatism is the assumption that certain people being at the top is overall benificial to society. And that is not a far cry from a hirarchy that says that certain races being at the top is beneficial."

I'm not saying anything about the merits of communism.

On the other side that, the owning class either supported fascism or stood aside. 

From this, I'm wondering what lessons to draw in the present day, when liberalism has run rampant and right-wing governments are on the rise. The US barely has unions anymore.

&gt; Toronto police say they’ve charged an officer and nine other men in an underage human-trafficking investigation.
&gt; 
&gt; The 49-year-old constable and the others are facing a charge of obtaining sexual services for consideration from a person under 18.
&gt; 
&gt; They say an investigation into the sexual exploitation of a 16-year-old girl started in November.
&gt; 
&gt; Investigators say they set out to find people who had paid for sexual services from the girl earlier this year.
&gt; 
&gt; The officer involved had 11 years of experience with the police service and worked in 51 Division.
&gt; 
&gt; The officer has been suspended with pay and will appear in court this month.

2020-06-19 15:05:52,GreatRolmops,"&gt; Do you really think the west will just give up global supremacy like this? Without even putting up a fight? 

It is too late already. China is the world's second economic and military power, and their growth and potential (being the world's largest country) is higher than that of the US or other rivals. The West has already lost its supremacy. We are already living in a world where countries like Russia and China can and do successfully oppose the West. See Russia's actions in Crimea and Syria, and China's action in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. 

Western countries might want to put up a fight, but the harsh truth of the matter is that countries like Russia and China are just too powerful to fight against. They have the most powerful militaries in the world and massive nuclear arsenals, so opposing them militarily is a no-go. And fighting them economically is no less difficult. China has an economic power that rivals that of the West, and its economy is heavily interwoven with that of Western countries, meaning that anything that hurts China economically will also hurt the West itself. Russia on the other hand has a high degree of self-sufficiency and can sustain itself largely on its internal market and trade with non-Western countries, making economic measures against Russia relatively inconsequential. 

Now, this sword cuts both ways of course. Just as the West has trouble directly opposing its rivals, so do they have trouble directly opposing the West. And so we are locked in a stalemate, it is all bark rather than bite. Just like in the Cold War, the West will have no choice but to accept that it has to share the world with authoritarian powers that have radically different values from that of the West.

&gt; Aslo I wouldn't calle almost 500 billions worth of sanctions barking and not biting 

Hah, you got that wrong. 500 billions is the worth of Chinese exports that the tariffs are being imposed on. The sanction is that the tariffs over these goods are increased by 25%. Given how even with a 25% increase in tariffs, China is still making big money over these exports, it is hardly something that will have an impact in the larger scheme of things. Though it might mean that China will start to focus more on other markets where profit margins are higher."

2020-06-19 14:33:44,Ciwan1859,"Good point.

I'd like to add that the state terrorism of previous Turkish governments (I won't say Turks, I actually like a lot of Turks) is what created the PKK. That went on for over 55 years where no one dared to speak Kurdish, where if you said you were a Kurd, you were put in jail.

Then Turkey wanted to join the EU and they eased off and even created a state run Kurdish TV to show the west, ""hey! we love Kurds, we have no problems with them, look we even have a Kurdish TV channel"" (very unpopular channel among Kurds by the way).

Kurds are supposed to forget the 50 years of oppression.

During those 55 years, many Kurds said ""F\*ck it, let's just be Turks now, I can't take this anymore"". They were fully assimilated. Those that assimilated were indeed treated equally. They became ministers, doctors, business owners ...etc. The [slogan](https://imgur.com/a/0pBfZBT) that they put all over South East Turkey, ""How happy is the one who calls himself a Turk"" was right ([here's another](https://imgur.com/a/QRWaPk0) where they're ""teaching"" kids the same slogan), I'll give them that, but it is so inhumane.

I feel terrible for Kurds living in Turkey, seriously. They've gone through a lot of sh\*t."

The meat of the matter is chipmaking, and when it comes to that, the world is far less reliant on (mainland) China than you'd think. Chinese companies are building factories trying to change this, but for now they're pretty insignificant. 

The biggest chipmakers are Intel (despite not showing up in market share graphs because they don't sell their manufacturing capacity), Samsung (a bit below 20% because while they do sell manufacturing capacity, they use most of it for their own products), and TSMC with its \~50% market share. 

TSMC is where most of the made in China chips come from, but that's actually a Taiwanese company with most of manufacturing happening in Taiwan. Of their listed 17 fabs, 14 are in Taiwan, 2 in mainland China and one in the USA. Samsung is the most invested in China out of the big 3, but still has most of its capacity outside of it. Intel has one outdated 65nm fab in China.

I'm a Syrian, and I want you to know that your govt is effectively starving the Syrian people right now.

They have tightened the sanctions on Syria leading to the SYP losing its value fast, not only that they've burned our wheat fields in the north so their will we will RELY on import WHICH WILL BE PAID BY DOLLARS THAT WE DON'T HAVE BECAUSE THE SYRIAN POUND IS WORTH DHIT NOW DUE TO THE SANCTIONS.

it's a systematic starvation campaign against innocent people to force a political change, THAT WE DON'T WANT.

You CAN call your senators and tell them to cancel the Ceaser bill that is STARVING Syrian people. Not the government, THE PEOPLE. people who have families and trying to live life, people who for example watched Game of thrones and got as disappointed as you did the last season, people who like watching football, going to the cinema, dancing, and watching Rick and fucking morty. They are as human as you are and are being starved to death by the US sanctions.

The sanctions have crippled the economy, it took the Dollar to SYP rate 9 YEARS to go up 1200% (1$=50SYP to 1$=600SYP) then ONLY 3 MONTHS to surge another 530% (1$=600 SYP to 1$=3200 SYP). That's a total of 6400%.

80% of the people were already below the international poverty line (1.99$ a day) so the last three months were DEVASTATING. the salaries lost value whilst the goods prices surged. With all the help from the government and NGOs it's simply NOT enough to compensate and the country is going into a famine. Edit : to make it look easier, the average salary dropped to \~12$ a month

I don't know who to tell this to but the majority on this sub seem like the people who will listen and do something.

Edit : credit to [u/hanni74bal](https://www.reddit.com/u/hanni74bal/) for parts of the first paragraph

Edit : rearranging of sentences and adding a sentence I missed.

Edit : . I hope more people will know what's happening and call their senators. they're doing stuff like this with little to no media coverage and most people don't know about it. From all my experience the VAST majority of americans are genuinely good people and get surprised when they know what their government is doing overseas. And it's not a trump problem and it'snot about one political party or the other, it's been going on since forever. JFK was the only one who tried to help and then got killed. Idk what for and it's not my point. but after that things are only getting worse. Please help.

2020-06-19 13:46:03,blackbartimus,India has been flirting with fascism since Modi has come to power. He’s been shown to have a blind eye for Muslims being attacked in mobs and actively encouraged religious tensions between Hindus. It would seem like this is part of a broader dangerous pattern of casting Muslims as second class citizens as India inches closer to religious authoritarianism. Hitler’s Mein Kampf is jaw droppingly considered a self-help book by Hindu buisnessmen and I’m pretty worried how things are going to play out.

The US and Russia aren't enemies anymore. Russia is just some annoying kid who likes to start drama but is basically harmless. Everyone knows Russia is in decline and is being massively surpassed by China. Russia has no ambitions anymore except to beat up a little on weak neighbors (Ukraine, Georgia) under very limited circumstances. 

&gt; At the govt. level they have moved on, back in Oct. 2019, Kissinger was invited to India along with other previous western leaders and top policy makers. 

That's good to know. 

&gt;100% with this, India has some very socialist labor laws that don't improve worker conditions but only hinder business development.

This is a big problem since India is a natural alternative to China, but the CCP made China VERY business-friendly, which is why international business flooded in. I see more businesses looking at Vietnam, for example, than India, and while Vietnam is much better than China, the United States should be promoting economic growth in democracies over communist countries if possible."

I'm afraid of this sub becoming a propagandic circlejerk, so I would like it if these posts were bundeled (reducing the number) and if there were also Chinese state sources and independent sources added (even though sources like BBC have no news, they do fact-check their articles somewhat).

2020-06-19 11:39:23,mittro70_,"&gt; China’s claims to the entire [Galwan valley](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/galwan-postscript-to-a-tragedy/article31863515.ece) in Ladakh, attributed on Friday by a Chinese strategic expert to “historical rights” going back to the Qing Dynasty, is being seen as an expansion of previously known Chinese territorial claims in the area.
&gt; 
&gt; The claims mark a shift from the past, and suggest [China now claims territory](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ladakh-face-off-satellite-images-show-chinese-activity-at-galwan-before-clasah/article31866359.ece) west of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and perhaps even up to the confluence of the Galwan and Shyok rivers. While most Chinese maps show almost all of the Galwan river within Chinese territory, the western edge of the river where it meets the Shyok river was not shown as Chinese territory previously in earlier maps.
&gt; 
&gt; On Friday, a leading Chinese strategic expert on border affairs at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), an official think-tank, made the claim to the entire valley in an interview with State media, citing “multiple accounts from the Qing Dynasty” that showed “historical rights”.
&gt; 
&gt; “Multiple accounts from the Qing Dynasty [1644-1911] and Western literature have recorded that the Galwan valley was China’s territory. Based on the principle of ‘historic rights,’ China has jurisdiction over the valley area,” Zhang Yongpan, a research fellow of the Institute of Chinese Borderland Studies at CASS, told the Global Times.
&gt; 
&gt; “In nearby Shyok river in west Galwan river, India built an airport, constructed bridges, roads and villages. For years, the country has been seeking to break into Chinese land,” he was quoted as saying.
&gt; 
&gt; This followed a statement on Tuesday made by the People’s Liberation Army’s Western Theatre Command spokesman Colonel Zhang Shuili, that “China always owns sovereignty over the Galwan valley region”. That was said a day after Monday’s clash in the area that [claimed the lives of at least 20 Indian soldiers](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indian-army-says-20-soldiers-killed-in-clash-with-chinese-troops-in-the-galwan-area/article31845662.ece) in the worst violence on the border since 1967.
&gt; 
&gt; #‘Exaggerated and untenable’
&gt; 
&gt; Reacting to the PLA statement, India’s Ministry of External Affairs described the claims as “exaggerated and untenable”.
&gt; 
&gt; The LAC runs east of the Galwan-Shyok confluence, and Monday’s clash was thought to have taken place in the area between the confluence and the LAC, on India’s side of the line. While the LAC has never been demarcated and there are differing perceptions in at least a dozen spots along the LAC, this was not among them, according to officials, and had not seen incidents in the past.
&gt; 
&gt; The [immediate trigger for the tensions](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ladakh-face-off-chinas-peoples-liberation-army-meticulously-planned-attack-in-galwan-says-senior-government-official/article31862371.ece) that erupted last month in the Galwan area is thought to be a road extending east from the Darbuk-Shyok-Daulet Beg Oldie (DSDBO) Road towards the LAC. The DSDBO road heading north was opened last year, providing key all-weather access to post at Daulet Beg Oldie, one of the northernmost points in Ladakh. China’s moves appear aimed at preventing the feeder road running east from reaching the LAC, and also strengthening its position immediately east of the confluence to allow it access to areas that would allow it to neutralise the strategically important DSDBO road.
&gt; 
&gt; “Chinese maps that I have seen show almost all of the Galwan river as lying within the territory China claims in the area,” M. Taylor Fravel, an expert on the Chinese military at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told The Hindu in an interview on May 27. “The one discrepancy would be the western tip of the Galwan river as it meets the Shyok river. Here, the last few kilometres of the Galwan river are often depicted as lying beyond China’s border. How one defines the parameters of the valley itself might be different than the river, however.”
&gt; 
&gt; While there is some ambiguity on where the extremities of the valley may be defined, recent statements suggest this includes the entire river, up to the confluence. Last month, Chinese State media described the road extension east of Shyok as an “illegal” construction into Chinese territory, in what was the first reference to claims west of the LAC.
&gt; 
&gt; The report on Friday said the recent clash “has brought the past flashpoint Galwan valley into the spotlight.” “Chinese experts stressed China owns sovereignty over the area, and warned them not to be blind to history and mislead the public,” it said. “Whether judging from China’s historic rights to the land and the Line of Actual Control, established to create a demarcation line and to ease tensions between the nations after the 1962 war, there is no dispute over the valley’s sovereignty.”
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Zhang said the valley, which was also a flashpoint in 1962, was of “strategic importance for both India and China.” “Maybe India thinks it could provide abundant water resources and is an important channel connecting China and South Asia,” he said. “India’s actions in the region also suggest that it intends to strengthen its control over Ladakh and Kashmir. India’s actions proved that it wants to enhance strength against Pakistan and China, and gain favourable geographical advantages."

2020-06-19 10:12:02,Renathras,"Relative magnitudes.

Not only that: Ad hominem.

Suppose you have a person that tortures and murders people.  This person sees a man about to rape a woman and calls him off, saying rape is a unique evil that no one should ever suffer from.

Should the woman say ""Hey, you stay out of this!  You torture AND murder people.  Glass houses and all that!""

Would that make sense?

Someone can be bad but still be calling out evil.

Hell, someone can be a WORSE evil and still be calling out evil.  To reject that call on the grounds of the person who said it is the logical fallacy of ad hominem.

And, in this case, China IS the worse actor.  If China had the same power and resources that the US has, do you really think it would be more benevolent with it?"

From their perspective, India can easily destroy that road if it wishes to, and set back a almost decade and billions of dollars of their progress in enforcing Belt &amp; Road, so they tried to bully India into backing off from construction work in the area. Ironically, if this conflict escalates, India gets a convenient excuse to destroy the road anyways, and set both their rivals back.

I still see very angry Indians complaining about this now, almost 50 years later. It wasn't a big deal and was grossly exaggerated, but even more importantly: times change. 

India is a democracy. India has no aggressive ambitions and is a fundamentally peaceful country. India participates in the world economic order without trying to disrupt or overturn it. India is a natural ally of the US, EU, and East Asian democracies like Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, etc. 

China, on the other hand, is only engaging with the world economy in order to disrupt and overturn it to replace it with a China-dominated world order. China wants to invade Taiwan. China wants to go to war with Japan and all of Southeast Asia over little islands. China wants to own and control whole oceans. China is a major threat to international peace and prosperity, and will never accept the greatest guarantor of peace: democracy.

While the US should absolutely embrace India, both militarily and economically in order to encourage multinational corporations to move supply chains outside of China, there needs to be more effort from India to court the US as well. It can't all be one-sided. The Cold War is over. India can still do business with Russia and do business with the US as well.

What India should really be focused on right now, is how to make India as business-friendly as possible to encourage supply chain factories to shift from China to India, while at the same time levying punitive tariffs on China to motivate these corporations to move."

2020-06-19 08:04:05,abrasiveteapot,"A command economy plans and specifies the outputs (we will produce N billion tonnes of steel this year etc and the factories get told what they have to do). China was definitely one of these under Mao.

The difference now is that the state (CCP)has someone on the board of most (pretty much all) large companies (and many smaller ones) and they oversee what's going on, but they don't centrally plan the outcomes anymore. BYD or whoever produce what ever they can sell, it's then sold at the market clearing / equilibrium price (the price was also controlled in a command economy).

The state keeps a finger in the pie and reserves the right to control any company but rarely uses it. As a system it's a lot closer to capitalism than it is marxism."

China is trying to take the land to discourage Indian road construction close to the border because they fear India could have easy access to key Chinese-Pakistani economic corridors. What China is doing is retarded, they're essentially picking a war with India because they they're afraid India will have the capability to pick a war with them(for reasons beyond any non-Chinese's understanding)."

In response to China holding the many waterheads in Tibet.

Honestly, given Chinese domestic political pressures, there's no way either side is backing down. India can't trust China to control their water, and China can't trust nor can it practice anything but ""Wolf Diplomacy"" under Xi. It sure as hell can't relax control of Tibet.

Ironically, India actually gets enough rainfall to not be dependent on the waterheads in Tibet, but the cost of building the infrastructure plus the growing population makes it unfeasible to not rely on them.

At least that's what I've heard."

That is a massive hyperbole if I've ever seen one.

&gt; there's a trade war that's been going on for a cuple fo years with the  US, Johnson and Macron are really turning on China lately, Merkel has  been eyeing up the Chinese violations of human rights for a while and  there is a discussion going on in Germany on wehter or not ban Chinese  companies from buying the German ones for the duration fo this crisis  (and possibly extending this to the whole EU), and even Trudeau is  starting to push back the Chinese buyout of Canada, 

So far, that has all been a lot of bark, but little bite. And given how economically powerful China is, it is gonna take a lot of bite to push it back. But our politicians don't have the guts for that. They are tied too much to their popularity ratings, and therefore to the economy. Ultimately, when push comes to shove, Chinese money wins out over moral objections. It is so today and I highly doubt it will be different tomorrow. A sad thing, perhaps. But such is the world we live in. Power and wealth are all that matter in the end, and China has a lot of both."

India has the world's strongest mountain forces, where the border is at. One Indian soldier up there is 10 times the value of a single PLA soldier, and there's little point in adding reinforcements at that altitude because neither their lungs nor their machines are gonna work up there for weeks.  
  
The only thing PLA does well is show off fancy machinery to give supreme leader a hardon, or crack down on tiny nations with weak militaries or their own people. If this border conflict continues escalating, China is in for a bad time."

You can't expect these things to happen overnight, and I assure you that while companies and associations like the NBA might agree on suspending their morals to gain access to the Chinese market, G7 isn't willing to yeld on global supremacy for that"

Besides, Iran is usually at odds with Saudi Sunni block, and Turkey has hostile relations with them as well, so Turks are out of the whole Sunni-Shia conflict and often have aligning interests with Iran."

China does this, but India does it as well. See for example India's imaginary 2019 airstrikes on Balakot in Pakistan where they claimed to have killed 200-350 terrorists but analysis by Australian intelligence and visits by international journalists revealed that India had not hit the target at all.

Now I think we can be pretty sure that this incident did take place, but regarding the numbers of combatants and casualties on both sides I would be extremely skeptical."

Well, let's just say that damaging your own economy doesn't tend to increase a politician's popularity. Therefore, the G7 will not take any serious action against China.

The G7 will stick to empty rhetoric and perhaps pinprick actions (such as tariffs) that are good for the press but have little actual impact on China or themselves. Meanwhile, they will continue to mass buy Chinese products, seek access to the Chinese market and grow richer by accepting Chinese money and businesses. And nothing will change."

2020-06-19 01:51:49,EduBA,"&gt;*Encouraged by the willingness of senior politicians to bow before them and swear, hand on heart, that they share their “pain,” activists who want to see the English-speaking countries given a thoroughgoing overhaul are on a roll. As well as trying to get rid of the police, they are toppling statues of alleged villains such as Christopher Columbus and defacing others of equally despicable individuals, among them Abraham Lincoln, Winston Churchill, Queen Victoria and Mahatma Gandhi. Streets are being renamed.*

&gt;*They also have their eyes on films they think show black people in an unflattering light: Gone with the Wind has just been scrubbed from HBO’s offerings. Books are next on the list of things that must go: zealots are ordering their followers to “decolonise” their personal libraries. For firms dealing in e-books, making readers comply should be easy; a righteous employee of the company distributing them need only press a button and, hey presto, the offending article will be removed in a twinkling from all its customers’ devices, which is bad news for writers who hope their works will have a secure afterlife.*

&gt;*The new rule is straightforward: like the Taliban, those who are proud to be “woke” (a once slang term which now means being belligerently keen to make everybody toe your particular faction’s line) should erase the unenlightened past. As many have pointed out, those who think and behave this way have much in common not just with the Taliban but also with the Maoist Red Guards whose war on everything old and therefore outdated had such a ruinous affect on China before her rulers came to their senses soon after the demise of the “great helmsman.” As far as the woke are concerned, having lived long ago when attitudes were different is no defence. If a dead white male, or female for that matter, harboured the wrong thoughts, he or she fully deserves to be consigned to oblivion.*

&gt;*So if you work for a big image-conscience company you had better join the chorus denouncing anything that could possibly be interpreted as racism. Keeping your mouth shut is not enough; activists warn us that in these troubled times “silence is violence.” All one can do is lie low, sporadically mouth the approved slogans and hope to go unnoticed until not just the virus but also the mental storm it helped set off has finally run its course, if it ever does.*"

2020-06-18 22:52:18,mittro70_,"&gt; * The drive will focus on 116 districts in six states, together accounting for over 6.7 mn migrant workers.
&gt; * The scheme will cover almost two-thirds of migrants who have returned home
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; NEW DELHI : The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Union government will launch a massive rural public works scheme, the [Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/job-creation-drive-to-focus-on-districts-with-highest-returnee-migrants-sitharaman-11592479599487.html), on 20 June to provide livelihood support to migrant workers and rural citizens and create a new social safety net.
&gt; 
&gt; The move is aimed at mitigating the impact of a stringent nationwide lockdown that brought economic activity to a standstill across the country and particularly affected the rural economy.
&gt; 
&gt; The scheme will be launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi via video conference in the presence of Janata Dal (United), or JD(U), chief and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar.
&gt; 
&gt; This is politically significant as Bihar accounts for large number of the migrant [workers](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/uttar-pradesh-forms-labour-commission-to-help-out-migrant-workers-11592364605571.html) who travelled to their hometowns and villages when the lockdown was imposed to contain the spread of coronavirus. The state is set to go to polls later this year and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar aims to retain power.
&gt; 
&gt; Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Thursday that the job creation drive will focus on 116 districts across six states, together accounting for more than 6.7 million migrant workers, which is nearly two-thirds of the total migrants who have gone to their villages and hometowns. The 25 welfare schemes that cover creation of assets, building houses and facilities for farmers will be pooled under this drive.
&gt; 
&gt; “Within 125 days, nearly 25 schemes of the government are going to be brought together and we shall reach saturation levels for each of those schemes within that period,"" said Sitharaman. The schemes for providing drinking water, road building, and house construction will be expedited in these districts for which the migrant workers who come back from the cities will be employed.
&gt; 
&gt; “In the 116 districts, the skills of the workers have been mapped,"" and everyone who needs a job will be hired, the minister said. “The objectives of the schemes will be achieved by the migrants who come back from the cities. The ₹50,000 crore focused job creation drive is frontloading of the already approved central budget, but any additional amount that needed will be added, Sitharaman explained.
&gt; 
&gt; The idea was to pool in from 25 projects so that at district levels, migrant workers who return will be employed during those 125 days and workers can be certain that they will have work where they have returned to, Sitharaman said.
&gt; 
&gt; The ₹50,000 crore programme is to include MGNREGS that allows for 100 days of work for members of rural households. The return of millions of people to their home states had resulted in some state governments demanding an increase in number of days of employment under the MGNREGS to 150. The MGNREGS has seen a major spike in the number of people seeking jobs under the programme since May.
&gt; 
&gt; Last month, the government announced ₹40,000 crore more for the rural jobs programme besides the ₹61,500 crore announced in the budget on 1 February.
&gt; 
&gt; This was part of the more than ₹20 trillion stimulus package unveiled by the Modi government in May to help individuals and small businesses tide over the economic challenges posed by the lockdown.
&gt; 
&gt; The government had in March announced a ₹1.7 trillion relief package, amounting to about 1% of its gross domestic product, to limit the economic damage caused by the coronavirus outbreak and tackle the loss of livelihood of millions of poor hit by the nationwide lockdown."

2020-06-18 22:27:56,DCFY7439,"The European Union will impose full customs controls and checks on goods from the U.K. from 2021, declining to reciprocate London’s plan to offer traders a six-month grace period.

“You can count on us to be forcible and systematic in implementing the deal, and in doing so certainly protecting the single market,” Joao Vale de Almeida, the EU’s ambassador to the U.K., said on a Chatham House webinar on Thursday, when asked if the bloc would mirror Britain’s stance. “We took note of the British decision, but we are not at the point in time where we either need or wish to take decisions on our side.”

Even if the U.K. and EU agree a free-trade agreement this year, replacing Britain’s decades-long membership of the bloc, companies will have to handle a wave of new paperwork and administrative costs. Goods crossing the U.K.-EU border will require customs declarations and products of animal origin will need health certificates. Without the right documents, there is the risk of border disruption and goods being held up at ports.

“I don’t think everybody has fully grasped this new reality,” de Almeida said. “We have to raise the awareness about the implications of this, with deal or no-deal.”

The U.K. is planning a ‘shock and awe’ information campaign from July onwards to encourage businesses to make preparations.

&gt; About 14 per cent of India&amp;#039;s total imports are from China.

&gt; The main goods imported from China include clocks and watches, musical instruments, toys, sports goods, furniture, mattresses, plastics, electrical machinery, electronic equipment, chemicals, iron and steel items, fertiliser, mineral fuel and metals.

2020-06-18 20:22:14,PikaPant,"This response of your's makes me think you're a decent person, so I don't wanna antagonize.  
  
I attend university in America, and there were a few occasions when certain friends who try and act woke and cultured asked me about why India is so Islamophobic or why Muslims are getting killed in India, and it's frustrating to hear this because these kinds of false and uninformed narratives are getting peddled around the world, and if you understand what I've explained above, you now understand why India ain't like that.  
  
Also, historically foreign influences have messed with India far too much, whether it's the Islamic invaders centuries of mass murder, rape, forced conversions and cultural destruction, or the Britishers who stole $45 trillion worth of wealth from the nation, or Pakistan whose sole mission is to bring down India, or the Chinese who are trying to invade our land, or the western media(especially in the UK and Arab world) who peddle all this nonsense about India.  
  
This government doesn't have any anti-Muslim agenda, that would be against the tenets of Hinduism. Feel free to visit India and have a nice time, you can eat beef(I used to eat, but quit eating it last year), and as long as you don't join the protestors(ie anarchists who destroy public property, assault police officers, and kill random people just for being Hindu), you won't get into trouble lol."
2020-06-18 20:15:44,bin00111,"Not sufficient details on what's the type for the Sukhoi's in the article, but I would guess Su-30MKIs.

I'm betting it's likely replacements for the failed PAK FA (aka. Su-57) project and replacements to the MIG-21s. Likely some would be used for parts/training. Likely India's were going to get more anyways and now seems like a good time to request more.

Don't look down on the MIG-29s and the SU-30/Su-27 variants. Sure, the models may have be dated if this was back before 1989. Those earlier variants are considered below or comparable to the older F-15 models. However, I'll bet they're new model variants carrying more updated systems. These versions--who knows."

2020-06-18 20:00:39,DCFY7439,"&gt;I said something very reasonable to begin with. Muslims constitutionally enjoy extensive rights to practice their religion, whether they want to have up to 4 wives, benefit from affirmative action to have an easier time getting into universities, have mosques receive monetary concessions from the government (usually at the expense of Hindu temples) or until recently, instantly divorce their wives through triple talaq(btw Modi government got criticism from Muslims last year for criminalizing this wtf). How can an intelligent human claim that a leader is Islamophobic when he and his government are the only ones brave enough to support the rights of Muslim women? 

Okay, see that was nice. How hard was that to explain to me without being jingoistic? Not that hard, right? Although I don't agree with you on certain things here but still I appreciate you explaining me why you think India is not Islamophobic.

&gt;I point this out by mentioning that India has favorable laws towards Muslims, and yet all your response is YOU STUPID INDIA ISLAMOPHOBIC, like all the other idiots across the world and in India who've fallen for a false narrative.   
&gt;  
&gt;There's nothing wrong with being critical about him. I for one am critical about some of his economic policies, the government could to more to boost certain economic sectors and infrastructure growth, and free the Indian economy from Chinese influence. But I'm not going to let people such as you spread lies and false narratives against India or its government, just so you can push your agenda. The least you can do is point out why I'm wrong and what about India makes it Islamophobic, but you didn't, you resorted to cheap sarcasm. And that's all you can really do, because you know you're wrong, India isn't Islamophobic, and you have nothing concrete to back up your point.   
&gt;  
&gt;I can't help but feel that foreigners such as yourself can't cope with the idea of a nation led by ""kaffirs"" prosper and become a superpower. The concept of Ioving one's nation might be foreign to you too, considering most Islamic Republics are hell, but it isn't for Indians, whether Hindu or Muslim. I suggest you mentally brace yourself for it, because nothing can stop India's rise any longer. 

Okay, you said a lot of stuff. Let me burst your bubble first. I don't live anywhere near India, I don't think about India, I couldn't care less whether India is a superpower or is led by ""Infidels"" (which obviously I don't think about Hindus, I am just quoting you here. I couldn't care less about Indian's religion). I don't wake up and think fuck India is becoming a superpower, what am I gonna do? Fucking India. I am getting poorer, my girlfriend left me, I lost my job because of motherfucking India. Hahaha, I don't do that dude. Come on. What do you think? All of us foreign Muslims are like Pakistanis who think 24/7 only about India and our only goal in life is to destroy India? Really? If me having a little banter with you and replying to you in few comments can get you rile up this easily, I think you would do better if you just temper down your jingoism a little bit. I am sorry to break it out to you but just so you know most of us are not jingoistic. We don't get into dick measuring contest about our countries. We couldn't care less about the state that we live in let alone a foreign country far away from us. Most of us just interested into geopolitics and want to have some conversation/ debates about the current happenings in the world. Honestly, I can't stress this enough, India's rise doesn't make us lose our sleep. Haha.

BTW, I would l love to visit India soon. I am Muslim so you know I eat beef. Just don't lynch me for this guys, haha."
