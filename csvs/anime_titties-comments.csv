I agree geography is not something that can be managed (or at least is extremely difficult). I was simply suggesting that your idea of how both countries are similar politically is based on statistics and evidence that suggest they are similar economically and socially, which is not the same. In theory, you can have two countries be politically ideologically completely different whilst being similar in terms of economic size and still having a large proportion of indigenous people.

The socioeconomic situations of both countries are due to many things, not just government management. Just because they have similar populations and have disparities between rural and urban areas (which many countries have regardless of size), does not mean they achieved what state they're in today in a similar way, and I would be inclined to think they haven't."

At the worst you have an unnecessary plasma transfusion, and with limited precautions that has serious risks, but if you were almost dead anyways, that would not be what kills you in the short term.  A transfusion of plasma is not really a big help compared to concentrated antibodies but it is likely to help some, and plasma is very easy. Running the plasma through a centrifuge and giving the fluid back to the donor so that you can get the antibodies concentrated from four or five liters of blood volume is a much more complex and expensive treatment.

my point is if you are barring certain people from coming in then it should be based on who they are not on what religion they follow which is absolutely unlike a secular country.

im not blaming them for what happened to them im saying think of your own people first not all those who are victims are inherently safe people just because they are sikh buddhist or hindu.

2020-07-22 11:32:18,PikaPant,"Muslim refugees are also welcome, but it takes longer for them to be a citizen than it would a non-Muslim. After all, the odds of a Muslim being a refugee from a Muslim country are far lower than the odds of a non-Muslim being a refugee from a neighboring Muslim nation."
2020-07-22 11:30:28,poopoofoopoo,"so they are judged to be safe based on religion? what if a refugee is muslim?

in the case of a muslim refugee wouldnt he be denied? isnt that bad?

point is there is no point making a law based on religion. just accept all refugees or check everyone before they come in. by making such a distinction they say that all refugees those who are not muslim refugees are safe to be admitted which is a essentially low concern for national security. they dont have to make religious distinctions but they chose to."
2020-07-22 11:28:30,UraniumIsotope,"Absolutely there are. I'm not saying Fox News is neutral at all, but this specific article is. It states what allegedly happened, but there is no judgment. There is no place in the article where it suddenly says ""and this is war happens in degenerate muslim countries"" or anything."
2020-07-22 11:25:07,PikaPant,"Yes, because India is diverse and the homeland of all sorts of religious identities like Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains, so the refugees are safe to be admitted and become citizens of India. That's that the CAA law is all about, easing this process for refugees."

2020-07-22 11:20:06,UraniumIsotope,The ones below the article. It was just a general statement to the people who see this post.
2020-07-22 11:18:20,poopoofoopoo,and all of the refugees that might come are safe to be admitted?
2020-07-22 11:11:04,PikaPant,"There is a difference between refugees and economic migrants. Most non-Muslims who come to India from neighboring countries come as refugees in an attempt to escape persecution in Islamic states because they're non-Muslims.  
  
Most Muslims who attempt to immigrate to India(largely from Bangladesh) are economic migrants who are looking for jobs and better wages, but their life isn't in imminent danger if they can't make it to India, unlike the non-Muslims in the Muslim countries that surround India."
2020-07-22 11:08:22,poopoofoopoo,"then why are there still muslims living in india? how do you know that the refugees are all innocent?

these kinds of method to give citizenship, taking national security into consideration, would be based on background checks, just because a person is muslim doesnt mean they dont deserve the same treatment because all muslims are not the same, that same way all sikhs hindus and buddhists are not the same. a secular country doesnt make laws based on religion because, atlesat here, anyone can be a good or bad person. no point looking at religion."
2020-07-22 11:07:28,poopoofoopoo,so all muslims that might seek refuge are actually after these people?

2020-07-22 09:33:08,Langernama,"#Greece says Turkish plans to map sea encroach on its territory
ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece accused Turkey on Tuesday of attempting to encroach on its continental shelf in a serious escalation of tensions between the two NATO allies at odds over a range of issues.

Turkey and Greece are at loggerheads over overlapping claims for hydrocarbon resources, brought into sharper focus by attempts of EU member Cyprus to also explore for natural gas in the Eastern Mediterranean amid strong Turkish objections.

An advisory known as a Navtex was issued by Turkey’s navy on Tuesday for seismic surveys in an area of sea between Cyprus and Crete. The advisory is in effect until Aug. 20.

Seismic surveys are part of preparatory work for potential hydrocarbons exploration. The Greek foreign ministry said the advisory covered part of the Greek continental shelf.Turkey and Greece are at loggerheads over overlapping claims for hydrocarbon resources, brought into sharper focus by attempts of EU member Cyprus to also explore for natural gas in the Eastern Mediterranean amid strong Turkish objections.

An advisory known as a Navtex was issued by Turkey’s navy on Tuesday for seismic surveys in an area of sea between Cyprus and Crete. The advisory is in effect until Aug. 20.

Seismic surveys are part of preparatory work for potential hydrocarbons exploration. The Greek foreign ministry said the advisory covered part of the Greek continental shelf.

“We call on Turkey to immediately cease these illegal actions which violate our sovereign rights and undermine peace and security in the area,” it said in a statement.

A protest had been lodged with the Turkish foreign ministry while the United Nations, the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, NATO and the European Union had been informed.

There was no immediate comment from Turkey. Ankara says it is within its sovereign rights to explore for resources in areas it considers its continental shelf.

Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said earlier on Tuesday that unless Turkey backed down, European Union sanctions against its NATO ally could be inevitable.

“As long as Turkey continues to take this path, sanctions on Turkey will be a one-way street,” he told German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, who was visiting Athens.

Greece and Turkey have had testy relations for decades, with occasional flare-ups. There was a sharp exchange of words earlier this year when thousands of migrants Turkey hosts tried to force their way into Greece.

They disagree over ethnically-partitioned Cyprus as well. Greece is also angry over a Turkish-Libyan deal carving out maritime boundaries that skim the southern Greek island of Crete."

Maybe not in your country but you can get an ak for a few hundred dollars sometimes even under that in war torn countries.

However, I have to admit, I feel like a lot of this is not so much the political status of a country, but just how similar two countries are full stop. Your argument for why the two countries are politically similar boils down to political decisions having a huge impact on both countries because they have the vast majority of their wealth within a small proportion of their populations, so the rest of their extremely large populations can be controlled quickly (in combination with their overarching aims, whatever they may be), and adapt fast to the world changing around them, even though they are the two most populated countries on Earth by a long, long way.

What I was expecting was describing their political systems, how laws work, what happens when people commit certain crimes, what politicians in local/regional areas can or can't do, the power of their judicial system(s), how they elect a leader, how their constitutions work (if they have one), their laws on citizenship, how they treat their minority populations, how their political parties are arranged and how manipulated (or manipulative) they are, how elections work and how much change they can perpetuate if it's the wish of their voting population, the organisations and/or countries they are participating with and their relationships between them (foreign relations and cooperations, alliances and enemies, which could be heavily affected by political ideology variations), whether they take part in forming international laws and following them similarly or differently (e.g. choosing to ignore most of them versus abiding by most of them, and/or participating in their creation/reformation), etc. 

That to me is what I would describe as the political status of a country, explaining how they operate and not what improved their efficiency to operate, which seems to be the general lines you're tugging. It's somewhat relevant, but there are many things relevant to politics. There are probably cases in the world of large mountain ranges between some countries having an effect on the politics between them, so you could even talk about geography impacting politics, but that isn't what I was asking for really."

""Of all the weapons in the vast Soviet arsenal nothing was more profitable than Avtomat Kalashnikova model of 1947, more commonly known as the AK-47, or Kalashnikov. It's the world's most popular assault rifle, a weapon all fighters love. An elegantly simple nine pound amalgamation of forged steel and plywood, it doesn't break, jam, or overheat. It will shoot whether it's covered in mud or filled with sand. It's so easy even a child can use it, and they do. The Soviets put the gun on a coin, Mozambique put it on their flag. Since the end of the Cold War, the Kalashnikov has become the Russian people's greatest export. After that comes vdka, caviar, and suicidal novelists. One thing is for sure; no one was lining up to buy their cars.""

2020-07-22 06:00:36,GreatRolmops,A lot of guns in Afghanistan were made locally by hand in small unlicensed factories. So it may not even be an official pattern of AK.
2020-07-22 06:00:20,Eleftourasa,"Oh boy. It's been a while since I've done an effort post. I've been looking into China and India for a very long time, and I've noticed a lot of similarities. It mostly boils down to demographics, the problems that arise from these demographics, and how these problems are handled. 

The most obvious similarity is their GDP. Both countries have very high GDP, ranking 2nd and 5th in the world, despite not being considered a first world country. Both countries have relatively low income per capita, and the country as a whole only reaches their high GDP levels because they each contain ~17% of the world's population. Because of their large population, small policy changes makes for insane leverage, giving both economies the potential to grow extremely fast (or decline very fast). No sources because that's easily googlable.

The second similarity is that the distribution of wealth is heavily skewed towards a small number of people. (and I suppose another similarity would be how both government tries to hide socio-economic data, but I'll get to that in a bit). Though official numbers are in the 0.3's, [a Gini coefficient calculated from CBDT data (tax income) was at 0.48 in 2013. (0.63 in 2016) ](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-proof-behind-india-s-rising-income-inequality/story-Khh2jqPaTHOFGCzuGoIc2L.html) A [similar estimate](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=IDD) was calculated by OECD, for 2011. China's suffering from the same problem, with their official numbers ranging from 0.48 to 0.46. But [independent studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4024912/) have shown it to be much higher ranging from 0.53 to 0.61 for 2012. 

As an aside, I would argue that this is intentional because then power is consolidated into a small group of people so that the force of an entire country is amplified in achieving a single goal, whatever that may be, and you don't have people in the country working against each-other. Leverage that with a huge population, and you can understand how both China and India are big players on the world stage. 
 
The third similarity is the reason behind this massive wealth/income inequality, and that is the disparity between rural and urban areas. Again, no sources because you can easily google this. I've looked into this a little bit, and this happens because there's a paradigm that investment into rural areas are essentially wasted because they don't produce high (or any) returns. If you refer to [page 30 of the 2017 OECD report](https://issuu.com/oecd.publishing/docs/ptt_india_feb_2017?e=3055080%2F69329588), you'll find that both India and China are at the bottom when countries are ranked by agricultural productivity. To counter this, there are incentives worldwide to invest in rural infrastructure in both countries. 

The fourth similarity is the ruling party's need for information control. You can track the number of times that India has shut down the internet, in recent times, here: https://internetshutdowns.in/. Currently, India is leading the world in this. Though China took this route once in XinJiang for almost a year, it mostly monitors and [enforces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCOAbkTs_a4) online activities. Not only is censorship limited to the great firewall with [over 18000](https://cyber.harvard.edu/filtering/china/) websites blocked, but it also includes certain news articles and discussions if you get them from a [Chinese source (wechat)](https://www.thestar.com/vancouver/2018/12/14/how-a-red-dot-kept-chinese-canadian-readers-from-getting-the-full-story-on-huawei.html). 

And though everyone and their uncle uses social media to various degrees, only seven countries uses task forces for the goal for foreign influence operations (attributed by Twitter and Facebook), two of which is India and China. [Executive summary (pg 2), third point](https://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/93/2019/09/CyberTroop-Report19.pdf)

The fifth similarity is demographics, in that both countries consist of multiple native ethnic groups, with a small minority of Caucasians / outsiders. This leads to a strong sense of identity and nationalism in both countries, which is actually not a good thing. 

All in all, you've got two countries in very similar situations. Relatively low GDP/capita but lots of capita, with wealth concentrated at the top, a lack of investment in rural areas, a desire to control information, and a homogeneous demographic. The only other country that comes close to fitting this profile is probably Brazil. And because of the similarities between these two countries, any action taken will have a similar effect on China compared to India."

99% of subs are controlled by partisan liberal mods. Leftists will call out perceived right-wing commenters like an immune cell marking a foreign pathogen. 

The idea is that the right-winger gets ganged-up-on with nasty personal attacks by that sub's resident wannabe Antifas, and then they all spam reports on the right winger to get him banned.

It's happened to me lots of times. It's one of the core ways that leftists enforce ideological purity in their subs. When you see the BLM/Antifa protests, the same thing happens IRL: anyone perceived to not be ""one of us"" gets marked and shadowed and verbally attacked until enough violent protestors are alerted to start physically attacking and intimidating. 

ALSO NOTE that even though the leftist in the mod's example drew first blood and went after post history 1st, it was the right-winger who got his post deleted for responding in kind, NOT the leftist, whose post stayed up even though he started it."

2020-07-22 04:10:10,tim310rd,"Look, when reading the news there are two components to it. What happened, and that the media wants you to think about what happened. Both sides will likely reference/describe the same event, maybe one side will omit details that the other side did not, but you can generally get a good sense of the event itself by reading news from both sides of the aisle. The next part is what the media you are reading wants you to think about the event, which may influence how they described the event but often it is done by referencing other events that are meant to serve as evidence to a specific conclusion. Both sides will likely mention different events, and by reading both you better inform your own conclusions. Each side sees the world through different lenses, in fact we all see the world through different lenses (literally), but we are still seeing the same world, and by understanding how each lense shapes their idea of the world you can better spot the flaws in your own lenses to get a clearer picture of the world as a whole."

&gt; TOKYO - Japan is paying 87 companies to shift production back home or into Southeast Asia after the coronavirus pandemic disrupted supply chains and exposed an overreliance on Chinese manufacturing.

&gt; Japanese automaker Nissan was forced to temporarily halt production at a plant in Japan in February over shortages of parts from China, while a Japanese consumer goods company, Iris Ohyama, found itself unable to meet surging local demand for masks after supplies to its factory in China were disrupted and export controls out of China were tightened.

&gt; It has now announced a list of companies that will benefit from the first round of subsidies, with 57 companies receiving a total of $535 million to open factories in Japan and 30 others paid to expand production in Myanmar, Vietnam, Thailand, and other Southeast Asian countries.

2020-07-22 01:10:41,pm-me-your-nenen,"The Taliban drag her parents outside, then she pick *her family* gun and shot them from inside the house. Later the Taliban go back for revenge and got repelled by other villagers and pro-govt militia.

This means it's very likely she used the gun before, it's not like Afghans in general will shield their daughters from learning on how to protect themselves. With her neighbors repelling the follow up attack, in such neighborhood it's even more likely that everyone has at least learn how to shoot straight.

And most of Taliban aren't elite troops trained to secure every corner. They think the family and the villagers will just cower in fear, so they stand outside the house, being easy target for pot shot. It's also possible in the first gunfight, other villagers rise up after watching their neighborhood getting executed, so the Taliban cut their loss and run instead of getting trapped."

2020-07-22 00:45:16,nightopenedmyeyes,You clearly have no desire to talk about police brutality. The only one who hasn’t discussed the topic is you.
2020-07-22 00:45:07,darlious,"Public opinion matters always, as it determines the reaction of other countries to the violation of treaty. You can place sanctions, offer citizenship (as UK has done - and it has public support), or impose more drastic measures like sponsoring resistance groups, arming the local population or engage in some form of military activity. Public support is required no matter what action is in question. We no longer live in monarchies so that the king gets to decide entire foreign policy. I highly doubt that the general public has been as involved at the time of signing of the treaty.  

'This' is high level of media coverage and involvement, 'give me liberty or give me death' parole, comparing the HK situation to American civil war, glorifying the protests even at times when it's 100 people protesting. If you remember the last years news, it was often stated even in public news, that the protests were brutal and police reaction was bloody, when all the numbers say that there were two deaths and some injured at long lasting half million people protests. Compare that number of victims during BLM protests. And the number itself of people participating varies from a million to 200000 depending on the source. 

It is formulated in a way that provokes emotional reaction.  

Having a third set of eyes is not wrong, it is useful and in this case mandatory, because they would be occupied tomorrow were it not for that. But it would be great if they were not blurred by emotions. When something is so greatly present in the media, people loose the sense of rational judgment and form opinions based on pure hate.

I don't doubt one bit that China is imposing authoritarian regime and censorship, but reaction to it is way more heated then when it comes to Uyghur issue because our own interests (western) are greatly involved. 

As per agreements, I'm just pointing out how it turned from 'treaty breaking country is bad and untrustworthy' to 'this is a single treaty that counts, our treaties are irrelevant' in two posts.  

I apologise for the personal approach, I got emotionally engaged.. which lead to an overreaction. 

It's bed time here, I hope I won't have to delete entire account in the morning."

2020-07-22 00:38:50,Mortar_Maggot,"Well parts replacement is a function of mass production. And there is no guarantee that a Czech part will fit Russian parts. Stiffening when it fires is otherwise known as recoil. And being loose before that mainly affects accuracy, badly.

The bald truth is that any gun will function once as long as you can get a round chambered and the firing pin is free to move properly. Any gun will function more than once with enough oil in it.

The sheer numbers of AKs has nothing to do with their ""superior reliability"" (that looseness breaks them as often as it saves them). It's to do with a concerted effort by the Soviet Bloc to manufacture as many as possible as a jobs program.

About the most you can say for it is it tolerates more grit in the action and it requires less technology to make. So in turn it's a good enough gun. It excels at being a good enough gun for organizations that cannot access or afford anything better."

2020-07-22 00:28:48,burtzev,"To whom is it ""disrespectable"" ? Or perhaps closer to the mark which regime do you wish to be a silly apologist for ? The George Floyd case resulted in one death. This incident resulted in two. The murder of George Floyd happened in public view, and it was swift. Much of the actions involved in this case were behind closed doors, and the victims lingered to die a few days later. 

The two cases are **very** comparable, and they exist in similar contexts of police brutality and murder. The victims in both cases stand as one more example of police murders that add up to thousands over the years in both countries. 


&gt;In Sathankulam, protests erupted after a father-son duo Jayaraj and Bennix were allegedly brutally tortured to death by the Tamil Nadu police. On 19 June, the police claimed that the shopkeepers had failed to close their shop by 8 pm in violation of the COVID-related curfew. Following an altercation, the police then arrested the shopkeepers. Witnesses report that the two were arrested separately and were stripped and brutally sexually tortured with batons/lathis at the police station. The father and son subsequently died in a hospital due to the injuries."

Find one buried underneath a building full of dirt and half rusted away? Brush it off and find some loose parts nearby, they’ll probably fit. Missing the stock? Slap a pistol grip on that bad boy. Parts feel a bit loosey goosey? Who cares, the thing stiffens you when you fire it by design anyway, it’ll just jiggle when not in use.

Edit: I seem to have offended true gun experts. Apologies. Please comment your accurate assessment of the ease-of-use and repairability of AK-47s.

2020-07-21 23:02:11,Samurai_Churro,"Technically, the USA government falls in the authoritarian right (though less extreme than the other examples, of course). A lot of this is because of lack of choice when it comes to voting. Most US politicians are either Democrats or Republicans, and either way they're usually bought out by their... *ahem*... constituents (corporations &amp; rich donors)."
2020-07-21 23:02:07,shoukawa,"&gt;Nothing is simple when you talk about area that has at some point been historically territory of different countries, because everyone sees it as their own. It was chinese prior to british colonisation. Yes, it should stay independant, and hopefully it will because it is culturologically and economically a different world, but it's by no means simple.

We agree it should stay independent so I’m not going to push this any further.

&gt;Public opinion matters because it influences opinions and actions that your country takes in foreign matters. A very famous example: US wasn't getting involved in WW2 on either side until Pearl Harbour due to public opinion, even though the government wanted to participate.

Public opinion matters BEFORE a treaty has been signed. This was signed back in the 1980s, and the terms have already been agreed upon. If public opinion could change the already concrete terms set in a treaty then international trade would be impossible.


&gt;This is about control and influence over the territory and is being promoted as help for HK.

What is “This” referring to? The CCP plans to institute martial law and punish anyone for dissent against them?

&gt;Also, I am not a CCP supporter. I believe that CCP presents the biggest threat to their own citizens and their freedom of speech and human rights. But this China hype has nothing to do with prisons, slaughters or reeducation camps, it has to do with economical threat to the US.

Never called you a CCP supporter just said you use their bad faith arguments. Try attacking the argument next time instead of the person.

&gt;Secondly, I very much know what it's like to have your country fight for independence, but also know what it's like to have war and bloodshed on your own territory and how long it takes for things to get partially back to normal. And I know how it starts, and this is exactly it, from both sides. So you can stick your righteousnes up your ass from your safe distance but if they start shooting those protestors it won't be american teenagers  that very loudly support the opposition on the line.

Straight to the insults I see. You have no solid evidence to call me sanctimonious or righteous apart from the US flair next to my name, which makes you seem prejudiced. You know nothing of my past, where I grew up, the people I know in these countries. I know full well the difference between keeping the peace and pushing an authoritarian regime. The HK situation is the later, not the former. And the US has a long bloody history I’m well aware of.


&gt;All I have stated was that most of HK people are not supporting total independence and that foreign opinion has been somewhat biased.

Source? How are they biased? Are Chinese government outlets not biased despite having clear motive? Are HK news sources not biased? Is having a 3rd set of eyes wrong in this situation? The US isn’t the only country waking up to China’s bullshit.



&gt;Secondly, Trump mentiones China at least 10 times a day. How is it not relevant. Pointing to hypocrisy is not whataboutism, it is pointing to hypocrisy. If you consider treaties so sacred and treaty breaker countries unreliable, I'm guessing that should include all of them.

Trump mentioning China has 0 to do with the joint declaration. Or even breaking contractual agreements. Point to where he has broke contractual agreements with China. Even if you did, explain how that justifies China breaking its agreement with the UK? You’re trying to justify whataboutism and it’s not working."

If Britain had admitted to and apologized for colonialist rape, then we wouldn't have this cheeky fun Uncle Winston cartoon character view of one of history's bigger scumbags.

Furthermore, this isn't just some accident, this is Britain's modus operandai.

2020-07-21 20:57:57,Skolanthropy,"Certainly, the footage needs to be shared and spread and condemned and questioned.

What I object to is BBCs rediculous reporting on the matter. Their frankly insincere hand wringing and over-aggressive posturing over the suffering of others aimed solely at stoking outrage in the viewers is done merely to increase viewership for the good of BBC, not the Uyghurs.

Manufactured outrage by journalist-actors who are rewarded via how many viewers they bring in (Piers Morgan comes to mind) will do absolutely nothing to affect change for the better.

Infact what it does is it misdirects our rage towards easy scapegoats that justify our anger, rather than lead us to true solutions. ""*UGH! If only CHINA would stop killing Muslims, good would prevail!*"" While in reality, if WE would economically self-sacrifice even a little, we could put sufficient pressure on China to treat their dissidents better.

But as it is, our governments don't care about human rights. They care about money to keep our citizens happy because *we* demand it. And the news media doesn't care about the suffering humans, they care about having an easy narrative for viewers to follow that doesn't present them with difficult choices about their own role in making this better. They are incentivized ultimately by money, by saying ""*Gotcha!* and getting 1,000,000 views before the next news cycle comes in and makes it irrelevant.

Share the video. Condemn this ""journalism"". Expect and demand better."

Strange. 

You'd use an example of a Middle power trading nation as the height of ""pissing people off""? 

Australia genuinely isn't even capable of registering large geopolitical boat rocking. 

Strange you'd use the white Australia policy as indicative of modern politics? Also not really sure drifting in to a nation's treatment of citizens by race is the best conversation choice considering China is making the same mistakes that many nations have in tge past unfortunately.

&gt;China is building up for that fight that is sure to come.

No shit, people aren't blind. All this talk of ""holding China back"" economically when you openly admit they are preparing for war... 

I honestly don't know what I can say, it seems you genuinely diminish the empathy and understanding of non-Chinese countries and their citizens as though they're not able to identify China's clear aggression and unfortunate human rights abuses, all the while saying Chna is both harmless and yet gearing up for war...?"

It was chinese prior to british colonisation. Yes, it should stay independant, and hopefully it will because it is culturologically and economically a different world, but it's by no means simple. 

Public opinion matters because it influences opinions and actions that your country takes in foreign matters. A very famous example: US wasn't getting involved in WW2 on either side until Pearl Harbour due to public opinion, even though the government wanted to participate. 

This is about control and influence over the territory and is being promoted as help for HK.

Also, I am not a CCP supporter. I believe that CCP presents the biggest threat to their own citizens and their freedom of speech and human rights. But this China hype has nothing to do with prisons, slaughters or reeducation camps, it has to do with economical threat to the US.

Secondly, I very much know what it's like to have your country fight for independence, but also know what it's like to have war and bloodshed on your own territory and how long it takes for things to get partially back to normal. And I know how it starts, and this is exactly it, from both sides. So you can stick your righteousnes up your ass from your safe distance but if they start shooting those protestors it won't be american teenagers  that very loudly support the opposition on the line.

All I have stated was that most of HK people are not supporting total independence and that foreign opinion has been somewhat biased.

Who's minds do you imagine were changed by this reporting? You called the Chinese ambassador to the UK a ""genocidal maniac."" Nice. You gather this from the interview or did you already believe it to be true? Did know who Liu Xiaoming is before this? China is a country of over 1 billion people, but sure, lets pretend like this one ass hole trying to keep his job by only saying the things he was told to say is a ""genocidal maniac"" who we shouldn't let finish sentences. Great journalism there.

Liu Xiaoming probably honestly had never seen that footage before and is likely kept at arms length from the questionable shit going on in NW China currently so that he can honestly deny all knowledge. 

But lets blame the diplomat and setup a ""gotcha"" interview where we don't let him talk...


You idiots are just gonna have us reduced to biting the ankles of whoever is closest, all while the CCP and your government cares not one iota about your *outrage* and instead looks only to $¥‎€.

2020-07-21 19:12:32,BornSlinger," The critics of Falun Gong see it as dangerous to the health of practitioners. Patsy Rahn writes: ”As Falun Gong practitioners will point out, Li does not specifically say anywhere in his writings that you must not take medicine or receive medical care. However, the teachings create an environment that is conducive to abandoning medical care. Illness becomes a test, and the refusal of medicine or medical care becomes the sign of a true practitioner” (Rahn 2000). The writings of Li Hongzhi at a glance certainly seem to suggest this. In the introductory book China Falun Gong, Li Hongzhi wrote: Q. Can I practice when I have a cold or fever? A. I will say that after you are finished with this class, you will never get sick. You may not believe it. Why do my students sometimes have symptoms similar to having a cold or fever? That is the passing of a tribulation and hardship, and implies that an improvement onto another level is due. They all understand that they do not need to pay attention to it, and it will pass. \[Li Hongzhi 1999a: 146\] At the same time, practitioners vehemently deny the allegations that Falun Gong prevents practitioners from seeking medical care.

 After examining the word choice they used, it looks as though Patsy Rahn may be right. The practitioners write that Li Hongzhi has not forbidden taking medicine, but his teachings do say that practitioners will not get sick. Also, the response from the Clear Harmony website notes that Li Hongzhi says that seriously ill people should go to the hospital immediately, but in light of his earlier comments, it sounds like he teaches that a practitioner could not possibly be one of those seriously ill people. Is it possible that after becoming a practitioner, a person will interpret all sickness as a tribulation and lose their life because of their beliefs?  

 He does not dismiss the fact that the fact that hospitals can cure diseases, but he does seem to feel that having your diseases cured at a hospital does not eliminate the karma, and thus the karma will still exist in your body to cause you more illnesses later in life.  

 Just looking at the teachings of Li Hongzhi alone seems to suggest that Patsy Rahn is correct in saying that Falun Gong creates an atmosphere conducive to the abandonment of medical care; this last question seems to indicate a connection between a practitioner having faith in Falun Gong to cure his illness and refusing medicine 

 She then read more Falun Dafa books, and concluded: “From that moment on, I began to understand how precious is the Fa…Not only did it purify my body, but it also eliminated some of my bad karma. How could I add things to my body? So I never went back to taking shots and medicine again” (McCoy and Zhang n.d.: 92). These passages seem to show that practitioners should interpret their suffering as a karmacleansing tribulation rather than an illness, and that to do otherwise is to lack confidence and conviction.  

 From these incidents, it appears that the Falun Gong personal experiences that are shared in a public way are intended to provide examples of how Li Hongzhi’s teachings have changed their lives for the better, which include his teachings about illness and karma. These practitioners are shown to interpret their pain as karma cleansing rather than illness, and as a result, miraculous recoveries occur. So far, it seems that both the writings of Li Hongzhi and the publicly available practitioner narratives support Patsy  166 Rahn’s assertion that Falun Gong creates an environment conducive to the abandonment of medical care.  

 To review, the accusation that Li Hongzhi forbids the use of medicine is untrue, but there does seem to be credible evidence that critics like Patsy Rahn are correct in stating that Falun Gong creates an environment that encourages practitioners not to use medical care. Li Hongzhi teaches that sickness results from karma accumulated over several lifetimes, and that medical care merely pushes the karma back to resurface at a later time, while Falun Gong enables the practitioner to eliminate the karma for good by enduring the suffering it causes. The publicly available practitioner narratives, intended to guide and inspire other practitioners, show practitioners enduring their symptoms and then feeling better after a short period of time. My research findings suggest that casual practitioners do not share this attitude towards medical care, but many of the faithful practitioners do."

2020-07-21 19:11:39,halfprice06,"I can tell you this there are no salaries paid to anyone.  Everything is done voluntarily.  The books are sold by a  nonprofit organization, and the book sales are used to simply maintain printing of the books. The books are also all available for free online, so it's really not a money making scheme.  

 There are a number of non-profit organizations that have been set up by Falun Gong practioners that operate things like websites and stuff.  Some of those take donations , but again the money is simply used to host the websites and things are done voluntarily and from the heart.  

Li Hongzhi has strictly forbidden persons from making money in the name of Falun Gong, from collecting donations from society in the name of Falun Gong, etc.  No one is allowed to collect funds from other practioners.  

See for yourself, go to any Falun Dafa exercise site or place where practitioners are set up passing out brochures.  Guaranteed there is no ""collections"" cup.  

Any religion that mixes in money is going to become corrupt over time as those things end up taking precedent and causing undue influence. 

Now if you are talking about Epoch Times and Shen Yun, those are a different story. Those are 501c non-profits and do have employees who have salaries, because they exist basically as  businesses in society.  They are stand alone from ""Falun Gong"". They just happened to be started by Falun Gong practioners.  But those organizations also provide a service (news, dance show) and thus it makes sense that they have an income.   But there is no profit sharing obviously (because of their legal status), and those companies have public financial statements.  And the salaries paid are pretty low considering the industry."

2020-07-21 18:19:27,shoukawa,"“Simple issue this, not so simple that. it’s not what as presented” can you explain further? This deflection frequently pops up from CCP apologists who think you have to live in HK or China to have an opinion or viewpoint, ergo silencing dissent from foreign parties.

Furthermore anything regarding public sentiment is non-relevant when discussing intergovernmental treaties and agreements. It doesn’t matter if 100% of HK wanted to be China again (which they don’t). Treaties were signed and agreements were made. If China can’t hold itself to even that basic level of policy then less countries are going to be willing to sign any agreement with them, which is bad for China in the long run."
2020-07-21 18:18:53,BornSlinger," Other people have attempted the topic of whether Falun Gong is a cult, so I’m not going to do that here. It’s kind of like a swearword that doesn’t actually mean anything specific to most of the people who use it. But I will make the point that Falun Gong is a much more secretive and controlling organisation than many people realise, it’s not a transparent group. While most of the core teachings are accessible for free on the websites, there are secret teachings and directives that are passed down verbally, and the discussions and forums that were once open to the public are now tightly controlled. Master Li’s published lectures and recent video are not simple transcriptions from the original talk, but rather are highly edited and redacted. All of Falun Gong’s websites, notably Clearwisdom.net which claims to be a forum for practitioners, are tightly curated. Master Li has made it clear that anyone who transcribes or records his talks and spreads them without his approval is undermining his practice which is a grave sin. And he has savagely criticised online Falun Gong-related forums like the Qingxin Discussion Forum where conversations among practitioners took place beyond his control."

There is none good or bad in a war while it's happening.
Hitler fucked with central europe. For the other side, britain and others fucked up the rest of europe in the mid 20th century.

Now, we look at history and realize that hitler was bad. Human scum literally. Whenever 'genocide' comes up, it's always about Hitler. What that man did was bad and it is morally correct to accept it irrespective of where you are in the world.

I'm sure while Churchill is being taught to be the good guy, you must have stumbled upon the sheer number of deaths caused by Hitler. 
It's in millions. 5.9 m alone for jews. Horrifying.
But if numbers were horrifying, you wouldn't have considered Churchill and his buddies to be the good guys. 
35 m Indians, a raw estimate, due to unnecessary famines caused by British policies.
Is it in any sense justified by saying something like 'sending the grains to the soldiers that are at war was more important'?
Really?
The war where at the height, 2.5 m soldiers in the British army were Indians themselves?

It's not a fight. It's not even an argument. It's about what's still hidden from people. I have seen the history books of British schools (No idea about other european countries). The information is out there and I believe the full extent should be known."

&gt;“The Chinese government also declared its basic policies regarding Hong Kong in the document. In accordance with the ""one country, two systems"" principle agreed between the UK and China, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) would not practise the socialist system in mainland China, and Hong Kong's existing capitalist system and **way of life would be unchanged for 50 years until 2047.** The Joint Declaration requires these basic policies to be written in the Hong Kong Basic Law.” 

This clearly says China has to fuck off from Hong Kong governmental policy until 2047. 

This has been infringed upon several times and the UK is well within their rights to withdraw from the agreement if China breaks the rules. Which they have many times now."

&gt;  
&gt;I think it was Lynn’s\* death that finally made me realise it was time to leave. I’d seen the writing on the wall about a year prior when I saw her at a yearly “Fa conference” for believers of Falun Gong, otherwise known as Falun Dafa, to exchange experiences and grow spiritually together. An executive assistant at a Queensland valuation firm, I’d gotten to know her over the years in various events as a warm and level-headed lady who had time for everyone. But I’d noticed she had developed a bulge on the side of her head and I was trying not to look at it when I talked to her. I saw, or at least I believed I saw, some pain in her smile. She was probably questioning herself over and over again what “attachments” she hadn’t let go of that were causing this sickness to spread through her body and endanger her life. I wanted to tell her to just go to a hospital, although I wasn’t at this stage resolute enough in my gradual return to logic. Another part of me feared that by looking at it I was acknowledging it — something you don’t do with illnesses in Falun Gong because Master Li Hongzhi teaches that his pupils don’t get illnesses. He can cure you but only if you don’t have any loopholes in your belief in him and his teachings. Some people with solid beliefs can actually die due to others around them having flaws in their thinking, Li says. Just thinking the wrong way is perilous when you’re a Falun Gong practitioner.  
&gt;  
&gt;I later heard through the grapevine of Lynn’s death. The cancer went into her brain and she passed away in extreme pain, probably believing to the end that it was her fault she was in this awful predicament. In a way, I guess it was.  
&gt;  
&gt;She wasn’t the first Falun Gong practitioner I knew who died from an illness after refusing medical treatment. Another, Sarah\*, did some gardening for my mother in Sydney for a while. She got along well with my mum and did a great job with the garden until her breast cancer became too severe. A staunch believer, she took on a number of big roles in Falun Gong organisations in Australia, including president of Free China and spokesperson for the Celestial Marching Band. She held out against medical treatment, finally accepting treatment when it was far too late. She had been spending her days not in a hospital but in pain in the living room of a family of practitioners, unable or unwilling to explain to the outside world why she hadn’t sought professional help. One of her last hurrahs was singing at a Falun Gong event, seated on a wheelchair on the stage. I listened to a recording and the music was cheery and full of hope. Quietly grieving her death, I called her mobile phone and listened to her answering message one last time, her calm and soothing voice, before deleting her contact number. I never told my wife or friends the truth about her death.  
&gt;  
&gt;That Falun Gong practitioners frequently die from treatable medical conditions is one of Falun Gong’s dirtiest secrets. A lot of Falun Gong practitioners have died this way. I heard about deaths often when I was involved in the community, typically middle-aged or older practitioners dying of cancers they didn’t treat. These cases would come up in group “sharings”, where we would meet regularly and study scriptures together then talk about them. And they would come up on the email lists I was on. Usually it was a request for practitioners around the world to “send righteous thoughts” to “eliminate evil interference” that was causing this person to become ill. Word would quietly circulate later that the person hadn’t made it.

&gt;  
&gt;What would it be like if qigong hospitals were allowed to be set up in China with a lot of great qigong masters treating diseases? **This will not be allowed because they all want to maintain the state of ordinary human society. If qigong hospitals, qigong clinics, qigong health centers and treatment resorts are established, the treatment of qigong masters will go down immediately and its curative effect will drop sharply once they begin to practise.** What is the reason? Because they are doing what belongs to ordinary people, they must have the Law as high as that of ordinary people and stay on the same level as the state of ordinary people. Its curative effect should be the same as that of the hospital. As a result, qigong treatment of diseases does not work well. They also usually require something like several courses of treatment of the patients.  
&gt;  
&gt;        With or without qigong hospitals, **it cannot be denied that qigong can cure diseases. Qigong has been popularized in the public for such a long time, and many people have indeed attained the goal of removing their illnesses and improving their physical conditions through practising qigong.** Whether the illness was postponed by the qigong master or however it was treated, that illness is not there now. **In other words, nobody can deny that qigong can heal illnesses. Most of the people who have seen a qigong master are those with difficult and complicated cases incurable at hospital. They went to a qigong master to try their luck and had their diseases cured in the end.** Those who can be cured at hospital would not visit a qigong master. Especially at the beginning, people usually don't think that way. Thus, qigong can heal illnesses. The difference is that it cannot be applied like other things done in ordinary society. A large-scale interference will never be allowed though **a small-scale or not very influential, unnoticed practice can be allowed**."

2020-07-21 16:44:21,BornSlinger,"&gt;I started practicing Falun Gong in 1998; at that time, my body and heart were purified. **After reading only ten pages of the book Zhuan Falun, every one of 13 diseases disappeared** and I felt very light. In the past, I'd suffered from a malignancy induced by hyperthyroidism, which manifested as swollen lymph nodes all around my neck. I had to support my head with both arms just to lay down when I slept. The doctor told me that it was too late to have surgery. **I also suffered from ovarian cysts and had to hold my abdomen when I walked. In addition, I had nasal inflammation, serious stomach disease, rheumatism, abnormal rapid heart rate, and other problems. After several medical treatments failed, I was so desperate that I wanted to commit suicide. Why was my life was so miserable? However, all of my diseases were cured after I read those first ten pages of** ***Zhuan Falun***\*\*.\*\* Even my husband felt that Falun Gong was miraculous.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;On another occasion, a person told me that his mother suffered from kidney failure. They had spent over 20,000 yuan on treatment. At that time, she needed weekly blood transfusions, costing over 1,000 yuan for each treatment. They couldn't afford the treatments, so his mother's health was deteriorating. They heard that practicing Falun Gong could save people, so he came to consult me. After I clarified the truth to him, he withdrew from the CCP. I asked him to tell his mother to recite sincerely in her heart daily: “Falun Dafa is good. Truth-Compassion-Forbearance is good,” and he agreed.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**TIME:** In your book \[Zhuan Falun\] you talk about people levitating off the ground but you say that they should not show other people. Why is that?**Li:** It is the same principle that Western gods in paradise should not be seen by ordinary mortals because they cannot understand its meaning.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**TIME:** Have you seen human beings levitate off the ground?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Li:** I have known too many.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**TIME:** Can you describe any that you have known?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Li:** David Copperfield. He can levitate and he did it during performances.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**TIME:** You have said that this type of qigong should not be used to cure illness. Why is that?**Li:** Healing illnesses belongs to the lower level of qigong. A person with an illness cannot practice to a higher level. One has to purify one's body in order to have gong. Healing and fitness are for laying a foundation at a lower level of practice.  
&gt;  
&gt;**TIME:** Would you use qigong to cure an illness?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Li:** I can do all of this, but I won't do it.  
&gt;  
&gt;**TIME:** When did you start teaching?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Li:** I am more than 40 years old, and I have been practicing qigong for many years. When qigong became popular, I did not come out in the public. I did not want to teach about stopping illnesses or keeping fit.  
&gt;  
&gt;**TIME:** What made you finally come out?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Li:** When these masters asked me to come out. At the time I said that there were too many people practicing qigong, and I said that I did not want to cure illnesses or to help people keep fit. They said, What you do will be different. These people who are teaching how to cure illnesses and teaching fitness, are paving the road for your coming out.  
&gt;  
&gt;**TIME:** Where do they come from?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Li:** The aliens come from other planets. The names that I use for these planets are different . Some are from dimensions that human beings have not yet discovered. The key is how they have corrupted mankind. Everyone knows that from the beginning until now, there has never been a development of culture like today. Although it has been several thousand years, it has never been like now.  
&gt;  
&gt;The aliens have introduced modern machinery like computers and airplanes. They started by teaching mankind about modern science, so people believe more and more science, and spiritually, they are controlled. Everyone thinks that scientists invent on their own when in fact their inspiration is manipulated by the aliens. In terms of culture and spirit, they already control man. Mankind cannot live without science.  
&gt;  
&gt;The ultimate purpose is to replace humans. If cloning human beings succeeds, the aliens can officially replace humans. Why does a corpse lie dead, even though it is the same as a living body? The difference is the soul, which is the life of the body. If people reproduce a human person, the gods in heaven will not give its body a human soul. The aliens will take that opportunity to replace the human soul and by doing so they will enter earth and become earthlings.  
&gt;  
&gt;When such people grow up, they will help replace humans with aliens. They will produce more and more clones. There will no longer be humans reproduced by humans. They will act like humans, but they will introduce legislation to stop human reproduction.  
&gt;  
&gt;**TIME:** What are the aliens after?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Li:** The aliens use many methods to keep people from freeing themselves from manipulation. They make earthlings have wars and conflicts, and develop weapons using science, which makes mankind more dependent on advanced science and technology. In this way, the aliens will be able to introduce their stuff and make the preparations for replacing human beings. The military industry leads other industries such as computers and electronics.  
&gt;  
&gt;**TIME:** But what is the alien purpose?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Li:** The human body is the most perfect in the universe. It is the most perfect form. The aliens want the human body.  
&gt;  
&gt;**TIME:** What do aliens look like?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Li:** Some look similar to human beings. U.S. technology has already detected some aliens. The difference between aliens can be quite enormous.  
&gt;  
&gt;**TIME:** Can you describe it?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Li:** You don't want to have that kind of thought in your mind.  
&gt;  
&gt;**TIME:** Describe them anyway.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Li:** One type looks like a human, but has a nose that is made of bone. Others look like ghosts. At first they thought that I was trying to help them. Now they now that I am sweeping them away.,  
&gt;  
&gt;**TIME:** How do you see the future?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Li:** Future human society is quite terrifying. If aliens are not to replace human beings, society will destroy itself on its own. Industry is creating invisible air pollution. The microparticles in the air harm human beings. The abnormality in the climate today is caused by that \[pollution\], and it cannot be remedied by humans alone. The drinking water is polluted. No matter how we try to purify it, it cannot return to its original purity. Modern science cannot determine the extent of the damage. The food we eat is the product of fertilized soil. The meat we eat is affected. I can foresee a future when human limbs become deformed, the body's joints won't move and internal organs will become dysfunctional. Modern science hasn't realized this yet.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the beginning you asked why I did such things. I only tell practitioners, but not the public because they cannot comprehend it. I am trying to save those people who can return to a high level and to a high moral level. Modern science does not understand this, so governments can do nothing. The only person in the entire world who knows this is myself alone.  
&gt;  
&gt;I am not against the public knowing, but I am teaching practitioners. Even though the public knows, it cannot do anything about it. People can't free themselves from science and from their concepts. I am not against science. I am only telling mankind the truth. I drive a car. I also live in the environment. Don't believe that I am against science. But I know that modern science is destroying mankind. Aliens have already constructed a layer of cells in human beings. The development of computers dictates this layer of body cells to control human culture and spirituality and in the end to replace human beings.

Seriously dude leave me alone. I don't appreciate you harassing me over two threads."

https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/meditation-in-depth

Simultaneously, its also true that medicine can cure certain life-threatening illnesses.  Thus, if someone is seriously ill, they should see a doctor and take medicine. 

The ABC article is raising false alarms.   They are painting a picture such as someone with cancer who stops taking their chemo because Falun Gong told them to just do these exercises instead.   And that couldn't be further from reality."
2020-07-21 16:36:57,spidernerd12,"The western countries are China's top trading partners in order to stop them from attacking China when it was weak.

Which is exactly what is happening right now with all the talk about self-sufficiency, Made-in-China 2025. Western talk of decoupling is actually perfect for China, because they want to decouple as well.   


And if you want to talk about pissing of your trade partners, then Australia takes the cake in that department. They are massively pissing of China without any action from China at all. They just got paranoid by Chinese rise and started to get aggressive about everything China. But again, this was entirely predictable by China who know how racist Australia is, it is the country that built with ""White Australia Policy"". They will never accept a non-western superpower. Same thing goes with most western countries who will never accept a non-white non-western culture Superpower without a massive fight.

However, most of Hong Kongers still support territorial unity and just want dual government. 

The problem I see, is that west is promoting total separation (independence) against the will of majority of residents and that is triggering China to impose even stricter grip, just to show it is in power as all the eyes are on HK right now. That will most likely cause even greater opposition and separation within the teritory. I've seen young Americans showing support by calling for blood, when it is not their ass on the line, just because they have heard the 'free HK' phrase all around and the protests look cool. Geopolitics is becoming pop media and the cirkelejerk about Hong Kong has come to the point where you can't state the fact that it does not want complete separation because we want it to become independent and not it's residents."

I imagine this goes back to 90s post colonial that said Britain would extradite suspected persons. Most countries have treaties like this so that people can't run out of dodge without facing consequences.

As for current probably because China doesn't allow Hong Kong to be as independent as it was. Hong Kong is pretty much asking for people to be extradited on false charges. Especially since the UK will be taking in more political refugees from HK."

2020-07-21 10:41:22,Langernama,"#Coronavirus: EU leaders reach recovery deal after marathon summit
**EU leaders have struck a deal on a huge post-coronavirus recovery package following a fourth night of talks.**

It involves €750bn (£677bn; $859bn) in grants and loans to counter the impact of the pandemic in the 27-member bloc.

The talks saw a split between nations hardest hit by the virus and ""frugal"" members who were concerned about costs.

It is the biggest joint borrowing ever agreed by the EU. Summit chairman Charles Michel said it was a ""pivotal moment"" for Europe.

The deal centres on a €390bn programme of grants to member states hardest hit by the pandemic. Italy and Spain are expected to be the main recipients.

A further €360bn in low-interest loans will be available to members of the bloc.

The summit, which began in Brussels on Friday morning, saw more than 90 hours of talks and became the EU's longest since a 2000 meeting in the French city of Nice, which lasted for five days.

[The package will now face more technical negotiations by member states](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/45109/210720-euco-final-conclusions-en.pdf), and need ratification by the European Parliament.

##How did we get here?
Mr Michel, the president of the European Council, tweeted ""Deal"" shortly after the 27 leaders reached the agreement at about 05:15 (03:15 GMT) on Tuesday.

The agreement followed a long weekend of talks between EU countries, during which tempers were often frayed.

Member states were largely split between those hit hardest by the outbreak and keen to revive their economies, and those more concerned about the costs of the recovery plan.

The self-proclaimed frugal four - Sweden, Denmark, Austria and the Netherlands - along with Finland, had opposed allowing €500bn to be offered in the form of grants to countries hardest-hit by Covid-19.

The group originally set €375bn as the limit, in addition to wanting conditions such as the right to block requests. Other members, such as Spain and Italy, did not want to go below €400bn.

At one point French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly banged his fists on the table, as he told the ""frugal four"" he thought they were putting the European project in danger.

The €390bn figure was suggested as a compromise, and ""frugal"" nations were reportedly won over by the promise of rebates on their contributions to the EU budget.

Another issue in the negotiations was how disbursements would be linked to governments respecting the rule of law. Hungary and Poland both threatened to veto the package if it adopted a policy of withholding funds from nations who do not meet certain democratic principles.

The European Commission will borrow the €750bn on international markets and distribute the aid. There will also be a means by which member states can reject a spending plan.

The deal was reached alongside agreement on the bloc's next seven-year budget, worth about €1.1tn.

##How have EU European leaders reacted?
French President Emmanuel Macron said it was a ""historic day for Europe"".

""Never before did the EU invest in the future like this,"" Belgian Prime Minister Sophie Wilmès tweeted.

Mr Michel said: ""We showed collective responsibility and solidarity and we show also our belief in our common future.""

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted. ""Today we've taken a historic step, we all can be proud of. But other important steps remain. First and most important: to gain the support of the European Parliament. Nobody should take our European Union for granted.""

Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who led the ""frugal group"", welcomed the agreement, but acknowledged the fractious nature of the talks. ""We are all professionals, we can take a few punches,"" he told reporters."

The most realistic approach I can think of is a transition away from outsourced manufacturing to more modernized automation.  Gradually raising taxes over the next decade on outsourced labor, but not so low as to not have a meaningful effect on transitioning manufacturing away from places like China. But all this is balanced with appropriate taxes on the automated manufacturing so as not to allow for greater wealth inequality. Among the many reasons the Trump tariffs have not worked to ""bring manufacturing back to the US"" is they are temporary measures the next president can undo. There is no incentive to make investments in a new factory if the pressure will just go away in 4 years. This needs to be made into law to make a lasting change."

2020-07-21 09:21:21,MiG-25,"Sounds like what you're talking about is a decline. I think its entirely realistic that China's influence declines to something on par with say Japan or Germany or UK. For example, in the 1980s, Japan was seen as a counter to American hegemony, but for a variety of factors Japan's growth was stunted. The rhetoric was eerily similar to what we have today, with Americans complaining of trade deficits and IP theft. Will the same happen to China? Maybe, and maybe not. Only history will tell.

You also bring up another point, what happens if there is conflict in the South China Sea? IMO, neither side will be willing to change the status quo, at least not for now. There is however, a risk of ""accidents"" in the heat of the moment, though I predict that if any conflict happens, it would be quick and localized.

I think that those, and the points you brought up may very well create a reduction in China's power and influence (or not, who knows?) though I think there would need to be much more for the entire government to collapse."

2020-07-21 08:44:41,HakuinRoshi,"China has just about started a half dozen wars on different fronts, ranging from small SE Asian neighbours through to the USA. Sooner or later a red line will be crossed, hopefully for a short, fast blaze up of hostilities  and there will be a consequent cessation of international trade.  If long enough the internal economy will totter and the simmering discontent of Chinese who so far haven’t gotten a piece of the action will explode.  I can’t predicate how big a bang, but the CCP is juggling plates, perhaps not wholesale revolution but enough disruption to start a chain reaction.  We will see."

There's nothing in the Falun Gong books or lectures about exorcisms or anything like that.  Furthermore, the teachings of Falun Gong state that if a person is very ill they should go to the doctor.  This couldn't be any more detached from reality.  

If someone is very ill and stops taking their meds, and then they die, don't blame that on Falun Gong.  That person just made very poor decisions and killed themselves."

&gt;Africans are heavily pro-China

&gt;people look up to China and respect Chinese success and governance

&gt;another genius move by Xi

To be honest mate I wouldn't trust the opinion of anyone so clearly sycophantic for their own nation and leader. 

I hope that you can understand your nation's rich heritage and history and see that its had many periods of growth and prosperity - and they weren't due to ""bucking the west"".

Im also not sure how you can honestly talk about genius politics of Xi shutting out the west considering [the top trading partners for China are] (https://howmuch.net/articles/chinas-exports-imports-trade-balance)

1. United States: $481 billion

2. Hong Kong: $304 billion

3. Japan: $148 billion

4. South Korea: $110 billion

5. Vietnam: $84 billion

Wow, all Western allied nations or territories with beef against China - genius move Xi! Piss off all your top trading partners because uuhhh... Something something new hegemony... Pride of a nation... Uhhhhh why is he doing all of this again? 

Oh that's right - he's terrified of losing power as a newly installed lifetime leader so he has to undertake a bunch of authoritarian moves like prison camps, suppression of democracy, debt trap diplomacy, and military flexing in order to control the hyper growth of a nation that gets more educated middle class members who can perceive CCP propoganda. Looks like you're unfortunately not one of them.

&gt;They need to decouple from the west and create their own international order with the rest of the world

The West is part of ""the rest of the world"" we have a world order in the form of several international bodies - a lot of which are calling out China for its illegal behaviour in the south China Sea.

Not sure why you think changing a bunch of nations around is somehow going to change the crimes China commits against its peoples"

Trump and his family have already committed many impeachable offenses and shown little regard for the constitution throughout his presidency, and he has a large and very armed minority of the country who will loyally follow wherever he leads. Some of his checks have been neutralized by a Republican Party who puts party over constitutional duty every time and said point blank that they would not allow a fair and impartial impeachment trial. He’s already been laying the groundwork for interfering with the election by screwing with the postal service and accusing Democrats of election fraud via absentee balloting. He’s even refused to say whether he’ll accept the result if not re-elected, instead saying “we’ll see.” In theory we do have checks and balances, but those have rapidly been eroding over the course of the last 4 years, and they should not in any respect take them for granted. We need to fight to keep them in place, or else we could easily turn into a sham democracy like China and Russia"

President Trump, does not have the power or authority to do what Jinping or any other CCP leader has done in China. Additionally, by having relatively fair elections, popular opposition gets a voice. If people are against Trump’s policies, they have the opportunity to vote him out of office after the short 4 year term limit. A president also only gets 2 terms as a of a more recent 20th century constitutional amendments, resulting in a maximum 8 years in the presidency.

Gosh, I sure do love a self own like this. Literally the second paragraph:

&gt; **The primary first-level political division of the United States is the state. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union.** Each state holds governmental jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and **shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government.** According to numerous decisions of the United States Supreme Court, the 50 individual states and the United States as a whole are each sovereign jurisdictions. The states are not administrative divisions of the country, in that their powers and responsibilities are in no way assigned to them from above by federal legislation or the Constitution; rather they exercise **all powers of government not delegated to the federal government by the Constitution.**


[Hence why we have incidents like this](https://www.usmarshals.gov/history/bridges/)

Also, this is why states can be removed or added to the union through 2/3rds majority ratification. Same to with amendments to the constitution or just federal law in general. States cannot simply choose to ignore something like integration, like in the case outlined above, just because they wish to have autonomy over the sovereignty of the federal government. 

I'm bewildered that this is so confusing to you.

&gt;You can share sovereignty in a federation, you big retard.

Everybody ""shares sovereignty*  insofar as they have autonomy beyond the scope of the primary state which governs them. But that is not what sovereign means in this context. What it describes is the highest authority of governance within a defined boundary. The United States is that primary sovereignty, not states and certainly not schools. Again, see Ruby Bridges. States, cities and PEOPLE have sovereignty over decisions that are not mediated by higher order governance.


&gt;Apparently you didn’t hear about the CHAZ/CHOP in Seattle

I'm well aware of what's been going on in Seattle. Not sure what this is supposed to prove...?

&gt;Also, what a coincidence that you left out California among the states that are doing the worst with the virus right now, how quaint.

I'm not leaving anybody out, I just wasn't about to rank every state. California is not doing well. Are you satisfied, partisan hack?


&gt;no state has done as terrible as New York,

New York's curve is flattening, while Florida and other red states are currently inflecting upwards. Particularly Florida is absolutely skyrocketing now. 

Compare the curves here:

https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/us-map

The Northeast just got hit first. If you think that the virus cares about red versus blue in this way, you don't understand even the basics about virology or epidemiology.  

&gt;Oh, but he‘s on the blue team, so we will make any excuse necessary to make it seem like retarded leftist Democratic policies are not the root cause of most of America’s problems.

I'm not making excuses, you retard. Keep strawmanning me because that's the only tactic you have. Cuomo made mistakes, Newsom made mistakes, Charlie Baker made mistakes. Most leaders have made mistakes to varying degrees during this crisis. I don't get what you think a whataboutism excuses Trump though. Trump is the president. He has an important role to fulfill and he has abdicated almost all responsibility, just blaming others constantly and downplaying the severity.

&gt;I will not vote for senile Biden

Biden is senile and Trump isn't? Have you ever heard Trump speak? It's often completely incoherent and he always brags about being *really really* smart but all evidence suggests he is actually quite the opposite. 

&gt; The modern Democratic party has gone so far to the left that they i’m surprised they can even spell the word “moderate” at this point.

This isn't even close to being true. In most other liberal democracies, the Democratic Party would be considered center *right*, not center left and certain not far left. If you look at countries like Finland, Canada, Australia, France, Germany and many others, even the centrist parties are completely in favor of universal healthcare, fighting climate change, strong social safety nets, significant paid parental leaves, free childcare, free education and so on and so forth....

Do you even know what it means to be a leftist? Because there isn't a single congressional Democrat who is actually a leftist. All of them are neolibs with a handful of social democrats in the mix. 


&gt;Fuck your identity politics, fuck your political correctness, fuck your welfare state, fuck your anti-logic policies, fuck your re-writing of history, fuck your pandering to minorities while screwing them over at the same time, fuck your historically debunked economic models, fuck Marx, fuck Pelosi, fuck AOC, fuck Bernie, fuck Biden and fuck you.

You literally don't know anything about my politics and haven't even bothered to ask. You are just throwing a temper tantrum because you know that the facts and data are not on your side. 

Anyway, riddle me this: 1) what positions do Tulsi and Andrew Yang hold that you support and 2) how are these positions closer to Trump's policies than they are to Biden's? 3) Also, why are both Tulsi and Andrew Yang supporting Biden over Trump?

I bet you can't answer any of those questions. Run away back to your safe space, [low IQ reactionary.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/millennial-media/201304/do-racism-conservatism-and-low-iq-go-hand-in-hand)"

So it comes down to politics to set policy and regulations to favour countries that aren't China, or at the very least level the playing field enough to counteract China's established advantages.

But yes, in the end it comes down to a lack of political will to make those changes, and that stems from a general disinterest/ignorance in the general population.

2020-07-20 21:24:40,MilesFuckingDavis,"&gt; Welp, I only needed to see you defending Nansi Pelosi to tell your bias takes precedence over your judgement. Pelosi is the very definition of a partisan hack, she was critical of Trump when he closed down the borders to China in the early stages of the pandemic, she went around telling people to visit Chinatown in San Francisco amidst the growing health concerns, and then had the nerve to start bitching at how everything was Trump’s fault, even though she and the Democrats wanted to keep the borders open as long as possible, even Biden criticized closing down.
&gt; 
&gt; 

The Chinatown thing is fake news if I've ever seen it. She was telling people this long before the US was beginning to lock down and her point was that Chinatown is no less safe than anywhere else people were mingling with one another. She was fighting xenophobia and this was long before the outbreak in the US really began to take hold. 

Again, everything she has done and said has been in line with what public health officials have said. 

**But that's not even my fucking point. I'm not ""defending"" Pelosi, I'm just point out that Dems and Repubs and especially Trump are not all the same. Apples and orange man. 

&gt;Look, you’re not gonna convince me

Yeah I can tell. You are the prototypical uninformed ""both sides"" dolt.

&gt;i’m not gonna vote Biden because there is no force on this planet that could make me vote for a fucking Democrat not named Tulsi Gabbard or Andrew Yang.

LOL, you are like a living, breathing perfect stereotype of the uninformed redditor.

&gt;I’m not convinced i’ll vote for Trump either at this point,

Good grief, mate. The fact that you won't consider voting for Biden but will possibly vote for Trump perfectly epitomizes low information, low intellect, low ethics American politics. You are potentially going to vote back in a criminal who tried to sell out American interests and corrupt our free and fair election processes (among countless other crimes and deplorable behavior). Cool, dude. What a TrUe pAtrIoT you are!

Lucky for the rest of us, Trump looks to be in very poor shape, politically speaking (and otherwise speaking), so I couldn't really give two fucks how you vote. Enough of the country can see things clearly that Biden (who I'm not really a fan of, btw) will probably sweep most of the battleground states. Republicans will also probably suffer down ballot as a result.

&gt;Oh, and the cities that have been affected the worst by COVID? Democrat-run cities.

Except *no*. I split time between Boston and New York and both cities are actually doing very well at the moment, particularly Boston. Meanwhile in Florida, Arizona and Texas....

&gt;Hell, Seattle had a full on communist takeover and the mayor just laughed it off as a “summer of love guys!!”

""Communist take-over""? I hadn't heard of that. Care to link to a source? Do you even know what communism is? I assure you that communism does not exist anywhere in the US or in the world, for that matter. inb4 ""China is communist!! Reeee!!! Hurr Durr!!!!"" Actually no it's not and if you think it is, it just goes to show that you don't actually understand what communism is. 

&gt;Each state is a sovereign jurisdiction, the federal government is only there to enforce federal law. 

This is a contradiction, you realize that, right? How can federal law apply in states if they are sovereign? Do you know what the word ""sovereign"" means, retard?

&gt;Trump quite literally did not have the power to close down nor enforce health guidelines within each state, that responsibility fell on the governors and mayors of each state.

Well that's not even what we're talking about... so...??? But nonetheless. Look at which states are enforcing shutdowns, mask wearing, etc. It's blue states. Red states are *still* fighting this, even while cases explode there. 

&gt;Ergo, the United States of America gets its name, it’s a union of states in the American continent. 

Dude, you are painfully ignorant of the history of the US. Do you realize that we literally fought a civil war over this shit? Do you *really* not understand what the Federal government is? Go back to middle school civics and take that course again, you clueless idiot.

&gt;Just like Germany could not enforce health protocols in France or Italy, they’re each a sovereign state.

(* ￣ー￣)

I'm losing IQ points just talking to you. Germany, France and Italy are separate sovereign states. California, Texas and North Dakota are *not* sovereign and are all subsets of **United** States sovereignty. 

I cannot believe I have to explain what [sovereign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty) means. Did you drop out before 6th grade or something? How are you this unaware of such a simple and common concept?

2020-07-20 20:32:06,MilesFuckingDavis,"&gt; However, the overall situation every state finds itself in is fault of their own governor, not of the president.

Why is that? What exactly is the role of the federal government if not to assist during a national emergency like this?

&gt;The reality is that if you lost your job, your area is disproportionately affected, your testing capabilities are low, your ICU beds are insufficient, then that falls under the responsibility of your local governance, not the federal government.

Why? Just because you say so? Is that your argument?

The truth is that all levels of government are supposed to coordinate efforts in order to maximize the effect of the response. It's not the sole responsibility of municipal, state or federal levels of government. All of these bodies are supposed to work together towards the same goals. 

[Take for instance the bidding war for ventilators](https://www.marketplace.org/2020/04/01/ventilator-bidding-war-covid19/)

The federal government should have appropriated and allocated these resources to states based on need, instead of needlessly allowing the prices to inflate so that middle men raked in cash from state governments competing against one another. 

&gt;bureaucrats are fucking morons

Not all bureaucrats, which is sort of the whole fucking point. Don't ppretend like there's an equivalence between Republicans, who hate and want to destroy most of the government, and Democrats, who want to make government work efficiently and serve as a public good.

&gt;completely incompetent at managing anything bigger than a 7-Eleven.

Then how come other countries aren't having these problems? Do you ever ask yourself that? How come other countries can coordinate these efforts, tamp down the curve and not bicker over partisan politics? Is it potentially because we have a moron in the white house and government obstructionists in the Republican party?

&gt;But to try to claim that this is due to the orange retard is completely dishonest and nothing more than political trash talking in hopes of swaying the election this year.

You are such a moron. Go ahead and continue the farce of ""both sides"" false equivalence bullshit. This is the exact problem with the electorate. People like you are too stupid to realize that the two sides are not equally to blame. 

&gt;What is the important number when it comes to COVID? It depends, what do you value most?

Spread metrics, hospital capacity, overall earths, serious cases, illness complications, etc. There are many metrics that are important. Only rubes would try to boil it down to one or two numbers. 


&gt;the chances that you will be infected with the virus at some point are pretty damn high. 

Not in other countries where they have it under control. This is the soft bigotry of low expectations if I've ever seen it. You've just resigned yourself to the worst possible scenario because you can't be bothered to hold the bad actors to account. Do you really think that Trump (who can't even be bothered to wear a mask) is the same as Nancy Pelosi (who has been following CDC guidelines the whole time, wants to get people's finances stabilized so that they can stay home safely and wants to *increase* [not decrease] levels of testing). Trump quite literally wants to and is making efforts to decrease testing so that the numbers don't look as bad. This is so antithetical to what our goals should be (including according to epidemiologists and other experts) that is' **fucking amazing that you keep writing off criticism of Trump as ""orange man bad.""** You are just a clueless dullard. You don't pay close enough attention to politics, so your default position is just ""both sides are bad"" and ""the media is hysterical about Trump"" and other such nonsensical arguments. 

&gt;and when I am I will either be asymptomatic (which is the likeliest case)

No, not necessarily. That's an unknown at this point and is highly dependent on individualized variables, many of which are still not understood. 

&gt;I will be sick in one of the countries with the best odds of survival, so either way i’ll be fine.

... No. You have your analysis so backwards. I'm not going to belabor the point, but one other thing you should consider is what happens when you get sick when hospitals are above capacity and resources have to be rationed. Are you really looking forward to getting the virus and developing symptoms when there aren't enough resources available?

&gt;Use whatever politically convenient metric or statistic you want, I don’t really care, the number I value most for me and my family is the number that we are doing close to the best at.

2020-07-20 20:28:18,spidernerd12,"I think you just showed how western/euro centric your thinking is. Xi Jinping's China has been a genius politician internationally. He has made China several times more respectable, powerful and connected nation to the world.

Don't believe me? Just remember where China was in 2012 before Xi jinping. It was a country with little influence outside East Asia. No influence in Latin America, Middle-East, Africa. Even ASEAN countries were mostly anti-China.

Then Xi Jinping came and started the Chinese influence expansion with Belt and road and AIIB. He expanded Chinese military power.

Now look at the difference. Africans are heavily pro-China and trade most with China, get most investments from China, support China in the UN and other international organisations. That's 1.4 billion people right there.

ASEAN is now mostly pro-China with Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar having much stronger dependency and relations with China than the west. Philippines is mostly neutral. Vietnam is completely docile. Malaysia is also pro-China. Thats 700 million people right there dependent on China heavily.

Pakistan is now firmly pro-China with strong alliance. Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka heavily dependent on Chinese trade, weapons and investment. They are also pro-China or neutral. They are no longer pro-India which they used to be in the past. So, China has a strong presence in South Asia now. Again all thanks to Xi Jinping.

India was already heavily Anti-China. Anyone that follows Indian media knows this. India was making anti-China moves by joining the QUAD 2 years ago. Then India did the Doklam standoff. China has now finally taken revenge on for making these anti-China moves and put them on notice that they have to be careful about taking anymore anti-China moves.

The same story in Latin America and Middle-East. They are so dependent on China that they support China on most issues such as Uyghur issue or Hong Kong. Iran is doing a huge deal with China. In Egypt China is heavily involved in making the new capital.

What China has done under Xi Jinping is that they have used their considerable reserve financial power and made strong connection with rest of the world. A world that has 8 billion people.

Europe and America and all its allies are nothing in terms of population. Maybe 1 billion in total. China has even stronger connection to 5-6 billion people now. These 5-6 billion people look up to China and respect Chinese success and governance. They respect Chinese technology and use it every day. They use Chinese branded products more than they ever did in the past.

These 5-6 billion people are the future. They are growing much faster than the west and will continue to do so for centuries. They west is already rich and stagnant. It will slowly grow even weaker relatively. Its overwhelming dominance is ending fast.

Ofcourse the west is furious with all this. But this was inevitable. Its good China has now faced the reality that it cannot be friendly with the west and has started hitting back. What is the point with being friendly with an enemy that will never accept you and will always hit you anyway. The west wants to contain China and that fact will never change. So, there is no point pandering to them. China milked the west as much as they could but that time is over. Its time to cutoff that dependency and focus on the rest of the world that is much bigger and has more potential.

They need to decouple from the west and create their own international order with the rest of the world. This is the next Chapter in China's rise to Superpower status. They must take this step in order to be fully self-sufficient. Again, another genius move by Xi by taking long-term realist approach to geopolitics. Enemies will always be enemies. Cut them off and make new friends. That's the way."

Japan’s government will start paying its companies to move factories out of China and back home or to Southeast Asia, part of a new program to secure supply chains and reduce dependence on manufacturing in China.

[[Image](https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/04/china-company-trailers-759-reuters.jpg)]: _China is Japan’s biggest trading partner under normal circumstances and Japanese companies have massive investments there. (Reuters/Representational)_

Japan’s government will start paying its companies to move factories out of China and back home or to Southeast Asia, part of a new program to secure supply chains and reduce dependence on manufacturing in China.

Fifty-seven companies including privately-held facemask-maker Iris Ohyama Inc. and Sharp Corp. will receive a total of 57.4 billion yen ($536 million) in subsidies from the government, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said Friday. Another 30 firms will receive money to move manufacturing to Vietnam, Myanmar, Thailand and other Southeast Asian nations, according to a separate announcement, which didn’t provide details on the amount of compensation.

The government will pay a total of 70 billion yen in this round, the Nikkei newspaper reported. The payments come from 243.5 billion yen that the government earmarked in April to reduce reliance on Chinese supply chains, with the money aimed at helping companies shift factories back home or to other nations.

As U.S.-China relations deteriorate and the trade war worsens, there’s been increasing discussions in the U.S. and elsewhere about how to “decouple” economies and firms from China. Japan’s decision is similar to a Taiwanese policy in 2019, which was aimed at bringing investment back home from China. So far, no other country has enacted a concrete policy to encourage the shift.

China is Japan’s biggest trading partner under normal circumstances and Japanese companies have massive investments there. The outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic has damaged those economic ties as well as China’s image in Japan. The government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been trying for years to improve relaations with China after anti-Japan riots in 2012, but the fallout from the pandemic and the ongoing territorial dispute over islands and gas fields in the East China Sea have undercut those efforts."

Back then the world wasn't as capitalised as now, that's true, but my grandmother said she always believed it was because it didn't hurt us that we did not act. We weren't going to risk another war only 20 years after the last as long as the germans didn't burn down our houses of prayer or froze our assets just because our mother was jewish.

We only realized they were going to come after us once they were done with their own country.

It's literally the only reason you could have for offering this attack on America up as relevant to the conservation. Basically when called out on whataboutism, you're trying to defend yourself by abandoning any claim of relevance. Why'd you bring it up, then, if it doesn't matter?"
2020-07-20 17:56:38,dekachin6,"Oh look, Chicom apologist whataboutism right on queue:

- You are talking about a tiny group of people in the US. In China, it is millions.

- You are talking about the distant past in the US. In China, it is happening RIGHT NOW.

- There are arguments in favor of sterilizing mentally retarded people since they cannot care for themselves, let alone children. These arguments were ultimate rejected many decades ago because Americans are overflowing with ethics and ethically err on the side of caution. By contrast in China, the CCP is trying to mass sterilize a population for no other reason than to commit genocide and clear them out to create ""living space"" for Han.

&gt;148 women sterilized without consent between 2005 and 2011 in two California state prisons.

A quick google produced [an article that said it was done with consent.](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/07/09/200444613/californias-prison-sterilizations-reportedly-echoes-eugenics-era) Valley State Prison's former OB-GYN, Dr. James Heinrich, says he offered the procedure as a service to women who had previously undergone cesarean sections. ""California used state funds instead, but since 1994, the procedure has required approval from top medical officials in Sacramento on a case-by-case basis.""

Regardless, it doesn't even matter. Nobody in the US is trying to commit genocide. In China, the CCP absolutely is. Big difference. You can't compare 148 women offered a free procedure they consented to who might have regrets about it, to the forced sterilization of millions. Disgusting.

&gt;America has a rich history and fascination with eugenics in particular, and is definitely no stranger to abusing its ethnic minorities.

If America ever did in the past 150 years what China is doing RIGHT NOW, America wouldn't have any problems with ethnic minorities now in 2020 **because there wouldn't be any left.** That's EXACTLY WHY China is doing this. This is China's ""final solution"" to problematic ethnic minorities: wiping them out, soft Holocaust style."

The world’s semiconductor heavyweights are concentrated in Asia and North America. The likes of TSMC and Samsung are good representatives of the Asian continent. In North America, we have the likes of Broadcom, Intel, and others. However, In Europe, we do not have such large semiconductor companies. We can mention a few like Dutch NXP Semiconductors and Swiss STMicroelectronics. However, these companies do not make as much impact as foundries in Asia and North America. Now, the European Union has set a goal to produce a good chunk of the world’s semiconductors.
According to the European Commissioner for Internal Market, Thierry Breton, the EU should pursue the production of at least one-fifth of the value of global chips and microprocessors. He believes that this is necessary to better compete with the United States and China. Furthermore, he said that semiconductors are a very significant part of technological development. From his speech, semiconductors drive various products such as smart cars, smartphones, and high-performance computers. For him, these “are the starting point of most critical and strategic value chains.”

EU currently accounts for less than 10% of the world’s semiconductors
“Europe has no autonomy in the field of microelectronics, there will be no digital sovereignty,” Breton said. Europe currently accounts for less than 10% of the world’s semiconductors – global processor and other microelectronics products.

Breton said he will also explore the establishment of the European Microelectronics Alliance, with initial public and private investment totaling up to 30 billion euros ($34 billion).

Following the recent strategy in China, EU officials’ plan to boost local chip production. Just like China, it is also seeking to get rid of foreign chip imports.

“In the face of growing tensions between the United States and China, Europe will not just be a bystander, let alone a battleground,” Breton said. “If we seize the opportunities of data, microelectronics and connectivity, Europe will be in the lead.”"

&gt;The Centers for Disease Control estimated in 1997 that 168,000 girls living in the United States had undergone FGM, or were at risk[290]....... Performing the procedure on anyone under the age of 18 became illegal in the U.S. in 1997 with the Federal Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act.[292] However in 2018, the act was stuck down as unconstitutional by US federal district judge Bernard A. Friedman in Michigan, who argued that the federal government did not have authority to enact legislation outside the ""Interstate commerce"" clause.[293] As part of the ruling, Friedman also ordered that charges be dropped against 8 people who had mutilated the genitals of 9 girls.[294][295] The Department of Justice decided not to appeal the ruling;[296] however, the US House of Representatives has appealed it.[297] As of August 2019, 35 U.S. states have made specific laws that prohibit FGM, while the remaining 15 states had no specific laws against FGM.[298]

÷

&gt;Not to mention spousal rape still being legal.

It isn't in Liberia

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_rape_laws_by_country

&gt;lThe law's definition of rape does not specifically criminalise spousal rape,[240] but ""marital exemption"" was removed from the law in 2006[241] by the Rape Amendment Act.[law 77]

Compared to many US, states, that's far better.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_rape_in_the_United_States

&gt;Maryland law states that, if the spouses are living together, a prosecution can take place only if the accused ""uses force or threat of force and the act is without the consent of the spouse."" If the spouses are separated they are treated as if they were strangers (See Section § 3-318)[32]

&gt;In Mississippi, a person can be convicted of sexual battery of a spouse when they are living together only if he engages in ""forcible penetration against the victim's will"".[35] This excludes, among others, situations where the victim is ""rendered incapable of knowing or controlling his or her conduct, or incapable of resisting an act due to the influence of any drug, narcotic, anesthetic, or other substance administered to that person without his or her consent"".[36]

&gt;South Carolina's statute on ""Assault and Criminal Sexual Conduct"" (Title 16, Chapter 3, Article 7 of the SC Code of Laws) lays out distinctively different definitions and penalties between rape by a spouse and by other parties. First and second degree sexual assault carries a maximum prison sentence of 30 and 20 years,[45][46] respectively, while 10 years is the maximum sentence for marital rape.[47] In order to prosecute, the married victim must report the rape within 30 days, even if they are living separately from their spouse."

They make earthlings have wars and conflicts, and develop weapons using science, which makes mankind more dependent on advanced science and technology. In this way, the aliens will be able to introduce their stuff and make the preparations for replacing human beings. The military industry leads other industries such as computers and electronics.

Then in 1979 a broad front revolution occurred due to the Shah's unpopularity, and Ayatollah Khomeini established Iran as an Islamic Republic.

&gt; WASHINGTON: Voicing concern over the recent Chinese military aggression against India, a bipartisan group of nine influential Congressmen have introduced a resolution in the US House of Representatives, urging Beijing that it should work towards de-escalating the situation at the border through existing diplomatic mechanisms and not by force.

&gt; &amp;quot;The Government of the People&amp;#039;s Republic of China should work toward de-escalating the situation along the Line of Actual Control with India through existing diplomatic mechanisms and not through force,&amp;quot; the Congressional resolution said.

&gt; Top Republican Senator Marco Rubio also recently called on India&amp;#039;s Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu to express his solidarity with the people of India as they firmly confront unwarranted and lawless armed aggression by the Communist Party of China.

2020-07-20 11:21:27,Langernama,"#How Ireland gets its way
An unlikely diplomatic superpower

Every st patrick’s day, Ireland’s ministers partake in a long-held Irish custom: they leave the country. Ministers are packed off to far-flung destinations to preach the virtues of the homeland. The prime minister always heads to America, but other bigwigs find themselves farther afield. In 2018 the housing minister was sent to South Korea, while the minister for higher education ended up in Oman. This year, as covid-19 raged through Europe and Irish politics stood still during coalition negotiations, things were scaled back. Only the trip to Washington went ahead. Ireland, a country of 5m people, had to settle for an audience with the president, a breakfast with the vice-president and a lunch with practically every senior member of Congress.

On a per-head basis, Ireland has a good claim to be the world’s most diplomatically powerful country. Its finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, last week won the race to become president of the Eurogroup, the influential club of euro-zone finance ministers, despite the French and German governments backing another candidate. In June Ireland won a seat on the un Security Council, fending off Canada, another country often flattered by comparison with a bigger, sometimes boorish, neighbour. Barely a decade after a financial crisis saw Ireland bailed out, Philip Lane, the former head of Ireland’s central bank, is the main thinker at the European Central Bank. In Brussels, Ireland’s commissioner Philip Hogan is in charge of trade, one of the few briefs where the European Commission, rather than eu governments, is supreme. And the eu’s position on Brexit was shaped by Irish diplomats.

Ireland has some natural advantages. A history of emigration blessed it with a huge diaspora in America, which unlike say the German diaspora, is vocal about its heritage. That ensures an audience in the White House and sway on Capitol Hill. It is a small, English-speaking country with diplomats able to focus on a few clear aims. A policy of neutrality helps it avoid unpopular military entanglement. Unlike most rich European countries, it carries no imperial baggage. Indeed, Ireland’s history as a victim of colonialism still provides a useful icebreaker with countries once coloured pink on Victorian maps. Nor is Ireland shy about using its cultural clout. Alongside more subtle overtures, the push for the Security Council seat involved free tickets to Riverdance and a u2 gig. The best that Canada could muster was Celine Dion.

It is in the eu where Ireland shows true diplomatic dexterity. It avoids easy classification. Ireland shares a lust for balanced budgets with frugal northern states, yet it endured a banking crash and the ignominy of a bail-out programme like Spain and Portugal. Though it is now among the richest countries in the bloc, it started life as the poorest, relying on eu funding to spur growth—a similar path to the one countries in Europe’s east hope to take. It is a member of the New Hanseatic League, a club of northern, liberal countries, yet it was among the first to back a demand from southern Europe for common debt to be issued by the eu and granted to struggling governments. Ireland can fairly be labelled as a northern, southern, eastern or western European country.

Ireland’s membership of a more informal, yet powerful, grouping is also key. Of the eu’s 27 members, only five have populations of more than 20m. The small countries have different agendas, but they share a similar goal: not being trampled by bigger neighbours. These relationships are cherished by Ireland, which has an embassy in every eu country—a rarity for a country of its size. For big countries used to having their own way through history, the eu is a way of maintaining power even as they shrink as individual actors on the world stage. For smaller countries, however, the eu magnifies their power beyond their wildest dreams. During last year’s Brexit negotiations, Irish diplomats were well aware of this fact, which took longer to be appreciated in London. The eu was never likely to side against a current member in favour of a departing one. However, it was thanks to Dublin’s patient, energetic lobbying that the border on the island of Ireland became the defining issue during talks.

##Letting other people have your way
Ireland was not always so influential. At the start of the decade, the country’s reputation was shot. A banking crisis led to an embarrassing €85bn bail-out. Rebuilding that reputation has been a decade-long task. Among the bail-out countries, Ireland became a star pupil, enacting reforms with almost masochistic relish, while other countries in a similar position complained. For a country whose prosperity is based on economic openness, foreign policy starts with economic policy.

There are still plenty of reasons for Ireland to be disliked. It hosts the European operations of many of the world’s largest tech companies, and its data-protection regime is lenient. For a while, the likes of Google and Facebook were watched over by a regulator whose office was above a convenience store in a small town 50 miles (80km) from Dublin. Although now a more professional operation, it is still seen as weak. When it comes to tax, kind words about the Irish disappear. At 12.5%, its corporation tax is the second-lowest in the eu. Often companies do not pay even that. In 2016 the European Commission demanded that the Irish government collect €13bn in back-taxes from Apple. On July 15th the European Court of Justice annulled the decision. Ireland’s tax policy was legally vindicated (although its coffers were less full).

A crackdown on Ireland and her fellow low-tax states is still brewing. But here Ireland has real power: each eu country wields a veto on the topic. There is less need for crafty diplomacy if Dublin has as much power to block as Paris. Now plans are afoot to clamp down on unpopular tax policies using methods that would bypass this veto. The only way of stopping such proposals would be via an alliance of countries able to amass a blocking minority. It is lucky Ireland has skilled diplomats. It will need them."

I studied Mandarin for a year at Peking University (Beijing U), one of the best schools there. I was just finishing my BA in mechanical engineering at that time from my school in the states, just a cookie cutter state uni. 

I naturally gravitated to making friends in the stem departments, and was mind blown to find out that many of them would go on to be car mechanics (that was most common), and many of them in the maths department were literally just repeating their high school maths until year 3.5 or 4. In the states, you could be a high school drop out drug addicted criminal and be a mechanic  

The reason for the maths is because some students went to technical high schools and had lots of math, while others went to schools that had little to no math. 

Some would go on to grad school to have hopes of getting a job that my degree was already capable of.

2020-07-20 08:28:02,ReadAllAboutIt92,Cause/effect: the revolution happened because the people were angry with the Shah’s cosy relationship with the US and they knew he was essentially a lame dog American puppet by the time the revolution happened. Ayatollah Khomeni seized on this anti-American sentiment and stoked the flames of revolution by encouraging Iranians to chant “Death to America” as a rallying cry. If the US hadn’t meddled in the first place I think we would see a very different Iran today.

And you're cherry picking data anyway. Fatality rate isn't everything. Let's talk about flattening the curve. What does UK's curve look like? Answer: the slope is decreasing. What does the US curve look like? Answer: the slope is increasing. 

Point being that there are a multitude of ways to analyze the numbers to make the US look better or worse than other countries, but if you look at the numbers (and policies) in aggregate, the US is lagging far behind where it could and should be. 

Even comparing to other counties is apple versus oranges, because every country has their own unique challenges in terms of demographics, wealth, density, etc. 

The overall US density is low, we are one of the richest countries on the planet and we *should* have our shit together. Yet we don't. We have a retard in the oval office who can barely pronounce 8th grade vocabulary words, let alone manage a response to a pandemic.

To ""abide by the infection rate""? What the hell does that even mean? That doesn't even make sense. Do you know what the word abide means? How can somebody abide by an observational piece of data?

&gt;Stop using old data from the WHO, who’ve been killing off their credibility as an organization piece by piece since this whole thing started.

I'm using the same data everyone else is using, you dunce. 

My point regarding the WHO is that they had already established the range for infection fatality rate that your asserted falls into... way back in mid February. Just goes to show ow uninformed you are.

&gt;The US numbers appear impressive

*facepalm*

&gt;But you know, people are bad with numbers and just regurgitate everything the media says because “orange man bad” is a doctrine more powerful than Christianity at this point.

Dude, *you* are bad with numbers and the fact that you think Trump isn't a complete disaster just goes to show which camp you're in. I mean this is someone who still keeps on saying that the virus is just going to go away on its own and that the whole thing is just a political stunt.

Feel free to dispute anything on that list? Got nothing? Then shut the fuck up already and stop defending this abhorrent response."

&gt; A former naval officer, charged with human rights crimes during Argentina&amp;#039;s bloody 1976-83 dictatorship, has been discovered living in Berlin - despite being the subject of an international arrest warrant.

&gt; Kyburg, who has dual Argentinian-German citizenship, escaped to Berlin in 2013, after fellow members of the military task force he belonged to were convicted in Argentina.

&gt; &amp;quot;As the commander of an elite combat swimmer unit, he is believed to have been involved in the kidnapping and murder of 152 people during the military dictatorship in Argentina,&amp;quot; said ECCHR. The discovery of Kyburg&amp;#039;s presence in Berlin follows the case of another alleged Argentinian torturer, Mario Sandoval, who was discovered to have worked as a professor at the Sorbonne in Paris, before he was detected in December and extradited to Argentina.

Here you go, do the math yourself. If you get COVID-19 in the US, you have a 3.67% chance of dying, which is better than the UK (15%), Spain (9.2%), Italy (14.33%), Germany (4.51%), France (17.26%), Canada (8.02%), Sweden (7.27%), Switzerland (5.86%) and Denmark (4.63%). This is just cold hard math.

Infection rate also needs to be adjusted per state, it is absolutely useless information for someone in Utah to abide by the infection rate of New York, the population density in these two areas is absurdly different, and the likelihood of infection will be way higher where there’s a dense population. 

https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-true-coronavirus-count-likely-ten-times-higher-2020-6?r=MX&amp;IR=T

The CDC says the infection rate is likely 10x higher than reported, which means the vast majority of people who have/had it don’t even know it. Stop using old data from the WHO, who’ve been killing off their credibility as an organization piece by piece since this whole thing started.

The death rate would actually be way lower if Gov. Andrew Cuomo didn’t decide he wanted to kill off half of the old population in retirement homes in New York, but I digress, we have to count the fuckups from our idiots too.

The US numbers appear impressive because you’re comparing a country with 328 million to countries with less than 100 million. At which point you may as well compare them to individual states, as they have more comparable population numbers.

But you know, people are bad with numbers and just regurgitate everything the media says because “orange man bad” is a doctrine more powerful than Christianity at this point."

- [He claimed that these insurgent groups are being backed by “strong forces”, in an apparent reference to China. This came as a surprise since China has been Myanmar’s closest ally in southeast Asia. Elaborating on the remarks made by the Senior General, the nation’s military spokesperson Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun later said that the Commander-in-Chief was referring to the Arakan Army (AA) and Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA). **The AA and ARSA are terrorist outfits operating in the Rakhine State of western Myanmar, bordering China. Pointing out that China-made weapons were used in mine attacks in 2019, the spokesperson claimed the AA was backed by a “foreign country”.**](https://thefederal.com/international/myanmar-seeks-international-help-against-china-backed-rebel-groups/)

Pretty obvious he's talking about China given the context. Don't just cry ""Indian propaganda"" without reading the articles and learning the facts. 

- [Myanmar’s Major General Tun Tun Nyi had said — “Most of them are Chinese and the total value is high. I would say the TNLA has illegally acquired weapons from China.”](https://eurasiantimes.com/now-myanmar-accuses-china-for-creating-trouble-in-the-country/)

Obviously India has a big reason to draw attention to this because the implication is that China is trying to carve off a piece of its border with Myanmar just like it did with India, but that doesn't make it propaganda. It's news, it's facts."

2020-07-20 03:29:16,MilesFuckingDavis,"&gt; How so? We now know the real infection rate is 10x higher than originally estimated. Meaning that if the estimated death rate was at 6%, the reality is that 10x people were actually infected, so the real death rate was actually 0.6%, which is astronomically better.
&gt; 
&gt; 

No, you're confusing the case fatality rate with the infection fatality rate. We still don't have an accurate picture of the infection mortality rate, but [the WHO was saying back on February 19th that based on modeling, it was likely between 0.3 and 1.0 among currently infected population (note that this can vary with changes in virulence and is different across varying populations).](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200219-sitrep-30-covid-19.pdf)

But all of that is completely meaningless, because your above comment said:

&gt;Compared to many other countries, the US has a fairly low death rate and never reached full capacity of the healthcare system.

Which wasn't true then and it's certainly not true now. The US has some of the worst outcomes of any developed country and it's largely to do with the fact that we lack a competent leader in the president. Trump refused to even wear a mask until a few days ago and downplays the danger and need for measures to prevent the spread *any chance he gets*. He's still doing this to the day—he just claimed today in his interview with Chris Wallace that the US has the lowest or one of the lowest case fatality rates, which isn't even remotely true. In fact, we're ranked 8th *highest* in terms of fatality rate. 


Not to mention that hospitals are already again exceeding ICU capacity and having to build overflow units. 

Next time you want to cheer ""USA! USA!""  maybe you should consider reality first.

edit: Oh by the way, fatality rate isn't everything. There are a lot of concerns that many people who recover will face ongoing health problems, including cardiovascular issues, lung damage, stroke, brain damage, neurological impairment and probably a lot more that we will learn about in due time). Fatality rate is only one metric to consider when evaluating the dangers and effects of this disease or any other."

&gt; Li Xiaoxia, the director of the Institute of Sociology at the Xinjiang Academy of Social Sciences, wrote in 2017 that high Uighur population growth rates exacerbated spatial ethnic segregation, &amp;quot;Strengthening the viewpoint that one ethnic group owns a [particular] land area.&amp;quot; Such sentiments are seen as dangerous, because they &amp;quot;Weaken national identity and identification with the Chinese Nation-Race, impacting long-term rule and stability.""

If anywhere near the majority of Muslims were terrorists or even violent the entire world would be in chaos. You realise that members of ISIS for example were fighting against Iraq and Syria, the terrorists were being fought against by Muslims.

You need to stop just saying all Muslims are violent and bad because most of them are not. Being Muslim is just a belief that some people have. Muslims can be kids playing on a playground, Muslims can start a family, Muslims can love their relatives. I know many Muslims and they're just like anyone else. I don't want to keep arguing mindlessly but for someone who constantly talks about other people hating you, you seem to spend a lot of time talking about why the other people are bad instead of just seeing them as other people.

You just keep throwing around factoids and random connections... And  you just won't get it and my only way to explain to you why what you're saying is stupid is spending 5 hours writting the basics to you. 

And don't get me wrong, I am just stupid enough that I've done that before but of course you wouldn't even read it and I'd get an even larger amount of downvotes since now I'd have made y'all seethe....


Imagine I go to /r/chemistry or something, look at a difficult sounding question and declare the solution is mixing lemon juice and hydrochlorothiazide (a word I just looked up and thought fits). Now of course I'd be wrong and I'd get downvoted and probably banned. But when it gets to politics, domestic and international, the problem is it all sounds simple, it is written in plain words and so everyone thinks they are ready to participate. But it isn't like that, such questions are far more difficult to have an opinion on, then exact sciences... Because it's interdisciplinary, inexact and vague.  And you need to have an understanding of all the pillars leading to it...

My professor used to do this series where he gave us a  seemingly easy problem, and in the first class everyone thought they got the answer, and it was always wrong, he then would explain the topic of the day on the basis of that problem, for 3 hours. And those problems would be hypothetical as to make them as easy as possible, they weren't intentionally made to look easy whilst infact being hard, no, they were simple problems made to reflect one very narrow topic. This doesn't work in other subjects because when you draw out an equation or a problem that's currently above the classes level, they will know so, and they might not even understand what the problem is or how to approach it. 

Anyhow, my first comment here was meant to be a joke, so I didn't think I'd be getting into some heated argument about Chaynah, and this isn't some issue that's specific to you, it's just political discourse in general, it always sounds simpler than it is."

2020-07-19 15:23:52,EduBA,"&gt;*Until very recently, even expressing an interest in demographic trends – let alone suggesting that a world with hardly any Greeks, Italians, Spaniards, Japanese, Germans and Russians left among us, would be dispiriting place – was frowned upon in enlightened circles where it was assumed that only right-wingers of a nationalistic bent worried about population decline in countries inhabited by people who are unwilling to have enough children to keep their own particular show on the road.*

&gt;*After all, we were told, the sons and daughters the Europeans and Japanese preferred not to have can be replaced by immigrants from Africa and South Asia who, as time goes by, will dutifully look after their ageing hosts by doing all those ill-paid but necessary jobs the natives find beneath their dignity. Among those who shared this sanguine view was Germany’s Angela Merkel who, to widespread applause, issued an open invitation, which was eagerly accepted, to all who wanted to come, before deciding it would be better to slow the influx for a while because it was causing her too many political problems.*

&gt;*The idea that in the last analysis only numbers matter overlooks the importance of culture, both in the sense anthropologists give to the word and the one preferred by those keen on what used to be called the humanities. If Germany were to be occupied almost entirely by Arabs, Africans or Pakistanis, would it still be Germany? Even if it retained its traditional name and everyone living there agreed to pay homage to Goethe, Kant and Beethoven, it would surely be a very different place. The same can be said about other parts of the world which are still in the hands of people who are on the way out.*

&gt;*For devout multiculturalists, individuals who insist that whatever the Europeans did over the centuries cannot be considered superior to the political, philosophical or artistic achievements of the natives of the Amazon rainforest or New Guinea because all cultures, with the possible exception of those developed by whitey, are equally valuable, it is reactionary folly to worry about the imminent demise of traditions that had lasted for thousands of years until, barely half a century ago, the heirs to them decided to call it quits. Perhaps it is in the grand scheme of things, but bad as some Europeans no doubt were when their lot were enjoying their brief moment in the sun, others have been every bit as cruel and ruthless as the worst of them, as a cursory glance at their histories makes clear.*

&gt;*One must also take into account the attachment some have to the languages, literatures and the like they think of as intimately theirs and which, they believe, help give meaning to their lives. Does the thought that all could melt away, or be swept aside by newcomers who find either contemptible or downright incomprehensible whatever the Europeans or Japanese did when in their naïve way they expected their respective cultures to last forever, trouble them at all? As far as most people are concerned, it evidently does not.*"

2020-07-19 13:10:15,Nethlem,"&gt; This is the neoliberal argument used time and again to rationalize globalization as the only possible economic arrangement.

I'm describing **actual reality** to you, not making some kind of ""neoliberal argument"", why do Americans always have to turn everything into politics?

&gt; It is absolutely possible to do these things, particularly in the US, it is a matter of will. 

You base that statement on what exactly? 

&gt; It is convenient for consumers to get cheap prices and it is convenient for producers to get cheap costs, but it is possible to go without either. 

It's also possible to not have a federal government or human rights, or have world peace. Still doesn't change that these are fictional scenarios and we live in the world we are living in with all of it's constraints.


&gt; And while few nations are blessed with everything and it makes sense for islands like UK or Japan to seek certain resources elsewhere with trade, the US has massive natural resources from farmable land for food, plenty of energy resources (both fossil fuel as oil as well as solar rich deserts and wind rich shores), it has a large infrastructure and manufacturing base, and it even has a large number of educated capital. It also has the best borders making it a fortress impractical to invade.

Sorry but that's just straight-up SaS, the US still doesn't have rare earths, just like not all infrastructure is the same because that depends on the local industries, if those don't exist then the infrastructure doesn't exist. To give you just one example: A while ago the [EU stopped exporting the ingredients for lethal injections to the US](https://www.dw.com/en/eu-stops-export-of-lethal-injection-ingredients/a-15615990), nearly a decade later the US has yet to create their own domestic replacement.

Not to mention that it's already been tried: Everything that China is manufacturing right now, [used to be originally manufactured in developed countries](https://youtu.be/SGJ5cZnoodY). But guess what? Turns out that people in developed countries don't really like doing tedious manual work that barely pays, that's why to this day even the US is importing lots of labor from the south when it's harvest time for the farmers.

Do you have any solutions for that except proclaiming ""nobody needs affordable products because we are all so rich""?"

Argentine did not want to see him in prison very much. 

According to the article, he has German citizienship. He cannot have aquired it after coming here in 2013, he so he must have had it before already. 

His last name sounds German (or Swiss), so he likely got his citizenship by having a German father or mother or grandparents.

There is no extradition treaty between Germany and Argentine. It is possible to extradite him nevertheless, but unlikely."

I'm saying not all Muslims are violent, that's true, that's very true, most Muslims are not violent. That doesn't mean a violent Muslim is good, but I never said a violent Muslims was good. This is a strawman argument where you extrapolate from my point. And again you ignore a blatant example of Hindu extremists taking 40 CHILDREN and shooting them and putting them in a water canal.

And on the topic of the Quran, every religeon has violence in their books. No one follows every rule of any religeous book. For example in the baghavad Gita it says it's okay to kill people if it's for a duty, just like how the Quran says to kill idolators. The Bible says to stone people. No one, again, follows every rule of their religeos book. Again most Muslims don't kill random people, most people don't. The Quran also tells people to donate to charity. Most Muslims, again, arnt violent. Some Muslims ARE violent, for example, terrorists, Saddam Hussein. MOST Muslims ARNT. Most Muslims arnt terrorists just like most Indians don't shit in the street. Most Muslims are average citizens born into Islam who live out normal lives, just the same as most Hindus. Some Muslims attack Hindus just as some Hindus attack Muslims.

I'm not saying all Muslims are peaceful, but you seem to be hell bent on all Hindus are peaceful and all Muslims are violent. I wonder who's going to extremes. I know there are violent Muslims I know there are Muslims who are terrorists, I also know the vast majority of them are not terrorists.

1983 Nellie massacre 1800 Muslims were massacred, considered one of the most severe massacres since world war 2, most of the victims were women and children.

1970 Bhiwandi riots was an instance of anti-muslim violencr which occurred between 7 and 8 May. Large amounts of arson and vandalism of Muslim owned properties. 

1987 Hashimpura Massacre when 43 Muslim Youth were rounded up driven to the outskirts of a city, shot and dumped in water canals.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_against_Muslims_in_India 

There's an entire wikepedia page about violence against Muslims in India. If a Pakistani said how come all Hindus are like this it would obviously be false. You can't keep generalising people. There are over a billion Muslims worldwide, a miniscule minority of them are terrorists. Also do you not understand what peaceful means? It means they arnt violent. It doesn't mean they stand up for others. I'm not saying they're right I'm saying they're not terrorists. If even 1% of worldwide Muslims were terrorists that's 18 million, and I can assure you there are less than 18 million Islamic terrorists in the world (if there were they would have gotten a lot farther than they have now). That's les than one percent of them. Stop saying Hindus vs Muslims the whole reason there's fighting at all is because both sides demonize eachother."
2020-07-19 05:47:56,werrt1234,"So how peaceful is the population of Pakistan then if Hindus keep being driven out and the gov. does nothing about it? I guess it's ok that hindus are being killed because they're ""peaceful"" when they do it. I guess you use that same argument when hindus are killed in Delhi, Kashmir, or West bengal. 

Tell me this, if Hindus take up arms will you disagree with that? If everyone is so peaceful in india and pakistan you surely wouldn't disagree? So Hindus will at least have self defense since the army wouldn't be around. Like you said, you disagree with the army being in kashmir or ""get over it , it happened 30 years ago."" So if Hindus can't have defense from the state they have to do it themselves, or will you disagree with that too? 

What's next? Is the taliban peaceful? Is ISIS? If not then why should Hindus just go be happy go lucky about changing times in India? They were that way in 1947 thanks to Gandhi and millions died. Are you ok with that?"
2020-07-19 05:36:18,rishicandoit,"The Hindu population in Pakistan is decreasing because Pakistan is made to be Muslim, that's the reason it split, I'm not saying it's right or wrong I'm merely stating what it is. The Muslim population in India is increasing because peke have a lot of kids, that doesn't mean they're treated well. You cannot keep dividing people based on religeon it's honestly stupid. I never said Pakistan is right and India is wrong, all I'm saying is you have to stop painting an entire population a certain way. Most Pakistanis are peaceful just like more Indians are peaceful."

Why does the gov. in pakistan refuse to do anything about kidnapped hindu girls? Why does pakistan continue to send money to kashmiri terrorists? Like I said I do not give a fuck about this ""most argument."" If even a significant amount go after Hindus that will end in a disaster. And no not all can be done by the Indian army. Hindus will have to fight as well for themselves like they did to save hindus in Noakhali and Calcutta. And why are you talking about Jammu and Kashmir ? There are still hindus in kashmir. Funny how there's more peace in a majority hindu area than Kashmir. This is obviously just coincidence I'm sure. Save the peace talks for the UN. When people have to defend themselves I'm sure people like you will go ""Oh hey but at least the majority is peaceful amirite."".

EDIT: The hindu population in terms of percentage kept decreasing in pakistan while the muslim one increases in India. Yet Modi is the ""HINDU NATIONALIST"" and I guess Imran Khan is the secular peaceful leader."

This is the stupidest thing you've said so far.

Also your entire fact is insane the population of Jammu and Kashmir is around 13 million and the vast majority of people arnt terrorists.

Here's some deep insight for you: Nobody outside the US really cares what party the current US president belongs to.

It is absolutely possible to do these things, particularly in the US, it is a matter of will. It is convenient for consumers to get cheap prices and it is convenient for producers to get cheap costs, but it is possible to go without either. Tariffs can put an end it. Restoring won’t be convenient but it is possible.

And while few nations are blessed with everything and it makes sense for islands like UK or Japan to seek certain resources elsewhere with trade, the US has massive natural resources from farmable land for food, plenty of energy resources (both fossil fuel as oil as well as solar rich deserts and wind rich shores), it has a large infrastructure and manufacturing base, and it even has a large number of educated capital. It also has the best borders making it a fortress impractical to invade.

Yes the infrastructure is crumbling under neglect and the number of morons is higher than ever, but USA is still well positioned to be independent of other nations economically. It is a matter of will. No other nation has it this easy to act on."

Funny how I never mentioned Trump but leftists like you find a way to inject Trump into LITERALLY EVERYTHING

&gt; the US only cares about itself

Honestly? I WISH that were true. Seeing all you hate-filled anti-Americans on Reddit, I have nothing but loathing for you. Unfortunately, as much as I'd prefer that the United States adopt an openly selfish, unilateral foreign policy, that's not remotely politically possible, nor is it anything that remotely resembles reality.

All you leftist **simps** pretended to kinda sorta love the US 2008-2016 while Obama was president just because that's how the international media told you to feel.

Now that a right winger is President, and the international media is all ""omg America I hate you now"" all you simps are back to your anti-American propaganda 24/7.

&gt;Believe it or not, the EU has a basic level of solidarity.

Nope, that's what Brexit happened (we're talking about the UK here, which is NOT part of the EU), and why you all were at each other's throats over Greece and other issues. You like to pretend you're all 1 country because that's absolutely the strat you'd need to fight the US, but it's not the reality and it's never gonna be.

All the ""united EU"" voices are just America-haters.

&gt;Right wing parties over here didn't win with the “country first“ ideology. 

They did in the UK. But you're right, you continental west euros are too far gone leftists to have actually competitive right wing politics. You all are in decline, China is on the rise, and I pray that the United States can reject leftism and not fall into stagnation like you ""sick man of europe"" leftists.

&gt;assuming that the UK is the same as America is just wrong.

I didn't assume any such thing. ALL Y'ALL ARE SELFISH. Pretending like the United States is the only self interested country in the world, and you all are somehow enlightened and ""above all that"" is a fucking farce. It's worse than being selfish, it's being selfish and lying about it."

UK vaccine made in UK would not have ""equitable access globally"" it would be used to benefit the UK first and then only after that's done would it be sold out to others. 

Everyone is sucking themselves off on how if they win the vaccine race, they'll ""share it with the world"" because they know the odds of them winning are slim to none.

No matter who wins the race, if they have a decent head start, they're going to exploit their win to selfish ends. That's just how capitalism works and there's nothing wrong with it. The wrong thing here is everyone being up their own ass pretending they won't act that way."

Another irony is that I know some Nepalis who all had Aadhar cards without any requirement of other documents. They even had ration cards for free rations without any Indian documents. They're allowed to freely enter the country becoming it's a Hindu nation.

&gt; MOSCOW - Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny said on Friday authorities had barred him from leaving Moscow while he is investigated for suspected slander, a move he said sought to stifle his opposition activities in the regions.

&gt; Investigators called in Navalny for questioning on Friday over a criminal case opened last month in which he is accused of slandering a Russian World War Two veteran who cheered on a Kremlin-backed reform package in a promotional video.

&gt; Navalny has called the slander accusation politically-motivated and said the case seeks to maintain legal pressure on him as a suspended sentence he is serving for a previous conviction comes to an end.

2020-07-18 16:44:34,Quantentheorie,"&gt; Argentina released a few and many of them commited crime again

That statement doesn't stand in isolation. It begs the question what prisoners were ""released"" and under restrictions they were placed. And it strongly points to incompetence and poor planning. 

I'd anyway love a source that a ""few"" were released and ""many"" comitted crimes again. Most prison systems should have a solid set of non-violent offenders or people who are not criminals of mere opportunity to choose from so a series of reoffences in just a few months provokes my suspicion."

2020-07-18 15:11:14,Merlota,"Summary:

Meaningfully impacting climate change will require less consumption not greater efficiency.

The resource examples given are metal and fertilizer use in the USA.  Fertilizer application got more efficient around 20 years back and use declined for a bit then rebounded as more crops were grown.  They didn't detail metal but with recycling increases and metal being about the only profitable thing to recycle, that one makes sense.

Is anyone surprised?  They are advocating ""conceptualizations of economy that do not rely on economic growth as the key route towards ecological sustainability and human wellbeing."" when they have also stated that consumption is the issue.  It is a disguised way to say if we want to save the planet get used to being poor."
2020-07-18 14:56:33,Merlota,"This would track right along with that statement. It is the article subtitle.

For the people who are going to call them terrorists, please read up on the Indian army's brutalities in Kashmir. Also, look up AFSPA, a law which basically allows Indian soldiers to inflict unspeakable horrors on the Kashmiri people.

Today, it has been almost an year since the Indian government imposed a curfew in the Kashmir valley, took away the little autonomy it had left and arrested all Kashmiri politicians including pro-India ones (most of them have been released since, but the curfew still hasn't been lifted). Kashmiris are being deprived of 3G and 4G internet for almost an year now to stifle their voices.

While it is true Pakistan has armed (and still does, to an extent) the Kashmiri sepratist movements, but what else are we to do? India has repeatedly rejected Pakistan's offers of bilateral dialogue and ignored Pakistan's calls to conduct a plebiscite in Kashmir in accordance with the UN's resolutions and the West has been suspiciously silent on the issue (compared to how much western media talks about the Ughyurs)."

2020-07-18 04:45:04,ZoraEbu,"As a Pakistani and a Muslim, I’ll try to answer your question the best I can.

Islam is tolerant of all religions, including Judaism (surprise surprise). Muslims have gone their own ‘route’ where they aren’t big fans of Jews for some of the wars in the past, but I digress. The flag of Pakistan is green to represent Islam and white to represent other religions (mainly Christianity). So, no, Christians should be free to practice what they want. Meaning that the artistic religious representation is strictly on Islam, and not Pakistan. However, the reason it was removed was most likely because of wrong guided Muslims/Pakistanis, who want Islam.

Tl;dr: Artistic religious representation is strictly on Islam, not Pakistan, and Islam is tolerant of all religions. It was most likely taken down because of wrong guided Muslims/citizens"

2020-07-18 03:35:44,AgentChimendez,"Good points. I agree that what has happened with nuclear industry has been incredibly frustrating. It opens a whole can of worms but I have a couple of quick points. 

Tl:dr As an analogy, my health is very hard to quantify and therefore I am more careful with it than my bank account. 

I think that the turn against nuclear energy is one of the earlier examples of the loss of trust ‘the West’ has faced in the wake of the Vietnam War. The suffocating level of regulation in response to this public opinion is something that I deeply wish our governments had been more effective in countering. 

At the same time, those regulations and expenses put in place have resulted with notably few accidents. 

Call me a ‘sentimental conservative’ or whatever but I don’t like our current balance and focus on the easily quantifiable economic terms. Yes they are important but if there are factors, as you acknowledge, are incredibly difficult to cost, should we not be more ‘conservative’ about social impacts? Preemptive regulation stifles innovation but reactive regulation to problems posed by companies like Facebook should be more cautious about the potential or observed social ills. 

I think a fundamental part of our loss of trust blinding us to benefits of nuclear and ills of YouTube are a lack of this form of sentimental ‘conservatism’ that opposes the standard economic conservatism. 

Socialist conservative? My politics are weird. More focus on empathy and less on profit. 

As an analogy, my health is very hard to quantify and therefore I am more careful with it than my bank account.

On the other hand, as a Pakistani muslim, If it happened in my city/district, i'd report it to the relevant Police department. Right now I cant even find a source to this news.. Each article is an exact replica of this and has nothing more. No village name nothing. If someone finds it do send it to me.

Till theres a source, I'd recommend everyone calms down, [Pro-indian sources generate fake articles that are anti-Pakistani and each sources one another to make it sound credible](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-50749764)"

The US certainly didn't say ""yo Pakistan, let's found the Taliban"" but that did indirectly happen after Pakistan had the resources to do so from the US, which is why I assign some of the blame to them

And you are correct that the Taliban did not rise until after the USSR backed Afghanistan fell, as most of the members were displaced children at the time of that war"

3. Atheism has always been there, and no, it's not that most young people are moving away from religion (you don't even have the numbers on that) but it's that the ones who do, a minority does it as a phase and constantly screams about how dumb religious people are, or constantly try tk argue against it (I have nothing against atheists, I know most of them respect religion)"

2020-07-17 21:21:23,Cuddlyaxe,"&gt;I should also mention that Pakistan isn't wholly to blame for the Taliban though. The US gave a shit ton of money to Pakistan to found the Talibs in which the Taliban were radicalized/trained, as they wanted fighters who would overthrow the USSR-backed Afghani government.

&gt;The US supported Mujahideen (English: Jihadist) groups which didn't all become the Taliban (in fact many later fought against it as part of the Northern Alliance) but the later, more radical Mujahideen groups that were mostly comprised of former Afghan child refugees in Pakistan were very much directly supported by the ISI and did become the Taliban


Pakistan *was* pretty much wholly responsible though. The US's Afghan policy was to like you said, give money to Pakistan to fund who they want. They never explicitly said they wanted to fund the more radical mujahadeen and they never actually supported the Taliban itself

Basically the US wanted to support anti Soviet forces in Afghanistan. They didn't know anything about Afghanistan so they went to Pakistan, their ally and said ""hey Pakistan, you want to fight the Soviets too right? And you actually know the people on the ground? Give this money to them""

Pakistan said ""thanks USA"" and then went on to use that money to fund radical Islamist groups which lined up with their ideology

The US never funded the Taliban though because iirc the rise of the Taliban happened after the fall of the Soviets in Afghanistan. It was essentially a group created by the Pakistani ISI of Afghani refugees in Pakistan refugee camps. They then sent those refugees to retake Afghanistan, and the rest ofcourse is history

When people say ""The US funded the Taliban"" they either don't really know what that means or they mean that the US funded Pakistan which funded some people who would later become the Taliban."

2020-07-17 21:10:00,Standard_Wooden_Door,"You can’t directly compare the two because you’re right, it’s near impossible to quantify a social, health or environmental impact solely in dollars. But you can certainly get a reasonable idea of whether it is worth it or not. For example, it would be very irresponsible to pass a regulation that would completely shut down an industry right? Unless we are talking about something like asbestos where many, many people died horrible deaths. 

What about the reverse? New nuclear reactors are banned in the US because of a fear of people getting very sick or dying if something goes wrong. The worst nuclear reactor disaster in the last 30 years resulted in 1 death and 2 injuries related to radiation. It was also a reactor designed and built over 50 years ago that only failed because it was hit by one of the biggest tsunamis and earthquakes ever recorded. As a result people have to pay more for dirtier forms of electricity generation. That’s a pretty stupid regulation.

So while we can’t measure exactly what the benefits of a lot of regulations would be, we can get a good enough idea that some glaring examples like the above should be no brainers.

I also see the US's funding of our military to make it THE dominant power for many years being a sign that our ruinous state is not entirely self-inflicted (although it is in large part).  I too hate where Pakistan is at and am not prideful of such a morally backwards nation -- I'm not proud of Pakistan. At the same time, let's not make such large dehumanizing generalizations such as calling me and others 'savage beasts' and 'subhuman trash' without the ability to reason.

2020-07-17 19:39:49,HikariRikue,It is very much so helpful showing how religion is causing various issues in the world though I wish it weren’t and ofc no surprise there is pushback on Christianity in a Islam dominated area that’s the issue they have and I’m honestly not surprised the same thing with the holy wars except this time it’s more political then kill don’t bother asking questions later
2020-07-17 19:37:30,HikariRikue,You can do all that without religion though that’s just being a good person which should be taught by parents

2020-07-17 19:31:36,WorldGranola,"im jewish. religion absolutely has value. Some of the main tenets of judaisim are Tikkun Olam (protecting the earth), Gimilut Chasadim (acts of loving kindness, and Tzedakah (charity). This is what my community values. Our religion is very open ended, we don't necessarily believe every story in the Bible. But we can apply the lessons to a modern day context. In fact one of our most important books in Judaism is the Talmud, which is straight up a bunch of different rabbis interpreting Bible stories. Judaism has taught me empathy for every person who's struggling. We do not necessqrily believe in a heaven and hell. What matters most is lifting everybody up so we can all be better people, be more holy. Judaism has a rich culture and history. My community is so important to me. My spirituality keeps me grounded. 

Yes, religions have been used as a tool for violence and division. But the manifest destiny assholes do not represent real Christianity, Islam, whatever. The people who use religion for malicious reasons are disgraceful. Religion should not be politicized."
2020-07-17 19:23:01,AgentChimendez,"Sure but how do you quantify the cost: benefit ratio of social cost :private profit. 

YouTube and Facebook make tons of money, employ lots of people and benefit from a low level of regulation which has spurred economic growth. This is good. But on the other hand our social discourse has been utterly poisoned and these tools are being used to perpetrate genocide. Or more to the point Gen Z’s utter lack of privacy and the impact it is having on their free speech and employability. 

Frankly, when it comes to protecting democratic and human rights principles profit has to take a back seat in my mind. If you can’t find a way to make profit while respecting human rights then I have no problem with that business failing. By focusing on an economic argument you leave out a load of externalities."

I should also mention that Pakistan isn't *wholly* to blame for the Taliban though. The US gave a shit ton of money to Pakistan to found the Talibs in which the Taliban were radicalized/trained, as they wanted fighters who would overthrow the USSR-backed Afghani government. 

The US supported Mujahideen (English: Jihadist) groups which didn't *all* become the Taliban (in fact many later fought against it as part of the Northern Alliance) but the later, more radical Mujahideen groups that were mostly comprised of former Afghan child refugees in Pakistan were very much directly supported by the ISI and *did* become the Taliban"

For Beijing, the recognition of the Consensus — and perhaps most importantly, the “one China principle” — is a prerequisite for restoring any official contact with Taiwan.

&gt; In May, the government of Guqiao, a town administered by the county-level city of Changge in the central province of Henan, issued a notice demanding all village committees to demolish temples.

&gt; Following the order, the temples in Gangli and other three villages under the town&amp;#039;s jurisdiction were demolished one after another.

2020-07-17 13:38:37,Langernama,"#EU leaders are meeting in their first face-to-face summit since the coronavirus crisis, with low expectations of a deal on a €750bn (£670bn) post-Covid stimulus package.
**EU leaders are meeting in their first face-to-face summit since the coronavirus crisis, with low expectations of a deal on a €750bn (£670bn) post-Covid stimulus package.**

[[Image](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9E8B/production/_113478504_merkel.jpg)]: _German Chancellor Angela Merkel - talking here with Finnish PM Sanna Marin - called for a realistic approach (Reuters)_

French President Emmanuel Macron said it was a ""moment of truth"" for Europe and the next hours would be decisive.

The main issue is how much of the recovery fund will be handed out in grants and how much in loans.

They also need to agree on a seven-year budget worth another €1.07 trillion.

Arriving for the talks, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said ""the differences are very very big and I cannot say if we will find a solution this time"". It would be desirable, she said, but people had to remain realistic.

The Brussels meeting is due to continue on Saturday but EU leaders may need longer to reach a deal.

European Council President Charles Michel acknowledged that the talks would be ""very difficult"", but Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said nobody should lose sight of the big picture - ""we're faced with the biggest economic depression since the Second World War"".

Estonian Prime Minister Juri Ratas said ""we need a fast, strong and united response to the pandemic to kick-start the European economy"".

##Why is the fund so tricky?
Southern states including Italy and Spain want an urgent decision ""not weakened by a lesser compromise"", in the words of Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. They need to revive economies battered by a devastating pandemic that claimed 35,000 lives in Italy and a further 28,400 in Spain.

The Frankfurt-based European Central Bank has already forecast an 8.7% slump in the eurozone economy this year because of the pandemic. But economies that only recently pulled out of a financial crisis want grants rather than taking on further debt.

[[Image](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/695/cpsprodpb/9963/production/_113476293_macron.jpg)]: _The French president said Europe was facing an unprecedented crisis
(EPA)_

The recovery plan, backed by France and Germany, for €500bn in grants and subsidies and €250bn in loans, is being resisted by several ""frugal"" Northern European countries, led by the Netherlands.

The EU recovery fund is already controversial as the money would be borrowed on the financial markets, to be paid back some time after 2027. It's made up of a number of different instruments, but the biggest part of it would be geared to supporting green and digital investment and reform. Some 30% of the funding could be tied to climate projects.

[[Inforgraphic](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/695/cpsprodpb/2928/production/_113463501_eu-stimulus-breakdown-nc.png)]: _EU stimuls composition. Where the €750bn will be invested. Source: EUropean Commission. (BBC)_

The frugal states, which include Austria, Sweden, Denmark and to some degree Finland, want some control over how the money is handed out. The Southern states say that will hold the process back.

There is also pressure to whittle down the size of the €750bn fund, so the solvency instrument devised to revive companies after lockdown could be under threat.

But Italian Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri told the Corriere website that Rome ""will fight hard not to modify"" the structure of the recovery fund.

##Why the rush?
Leaders have been criss-crossing Europe ahead of the summit in a bid to find a solution. Visiting Sweden, Spain's Pedro Sánchez warned: ""If we delay the response, we delay the recovery and the crisis could get worse.""

The head of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, has also urged the EU27 to move quickly on an ""ambitious package"", warning that uncertainty remains high on the speed and scale of the economic rebound.

[[Graph](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/695/cpsprodpb/7748/production/_113463503_eu_grants-nc.png)]: _EU stimulus for members' economies. Grants by country. Source European Commission. (BBC)_

If the package of grants or loans is agreed, then France would be able to put €39bn of EU funding towards its own €100bn national recovery plan. Prime Minister Jean Castex said this week that €20bn of that would go towards insulating buildings, and converting cities to using bicycles.

A group of 150 scientists and celebrities joined climate activist Greta Thunberg on Thursday in signing an open letter urging EU leaders to end ""all investments in fossil fuel exploration and extraction"".

As eurozone economic activity picks up and lockdowns are lifted, there are fears of a second surge.

The ECB has confirmed its emergency €1.35tn bond-buying programme is on track to last until June next year, to help governments, banks and businesses.

##Are the Dutch out on a limb?
One of the main issues for EU leaders is whether any country can have a veto over money being handed out to a member state for recovery purposes.

Ahead of the summit, a French official said the Netherlands was the only one of the so-called frugal states seeking strict control of conditions for paying out funds.

Is that true? Certainly Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte insists on reforms to pensions, welfare and tax services in return for funding and he wants assurances that the money goes to modernising infrastructure and green investment.

But Finland too wants conditions attached to EU funding, both from the recovery pot and from the wider 2021-27 EU budget.

[[Image](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/485/socialembed/https://twitter.com/FinlandinEU/status/1283426065923354624?s=20~/news/world-europe-53429064)]: _Screenshot of a tweet (@FinlandinEU)_

The task facing EU leaders is to agree not only on the size and terms of the recovery fund, but the overall EU budget too.

And Hungary's Viktor Orban has threatened to derail both the fund and the budget if any payments are linked to a member state's rule of law.

His ruling Fidesz party has been suspended by the big European People's Party bloc for clamping down on media and civil society.

""We could veto it because it needs a unanimous decision. Hungary could say no,"" Mr Orban said last week."

2020-07-17 11:16:01,beholdersi,"Let’s see what we have here. Active mostly in r/conservative, that inspires confidence, plus a random smattering of other subs.

Post history...oh boy.

Leftists are bad, leftists are bad, leftists hate America, blah blah blah.

Banned from assorted subs...oh wow. Banned from r/pics for “facts.” Let’s pick that apart first. 

My own research backs up your findings: Sean Worsley stopped at a gas station (not illegal) playing loud music (violating noise ordinance). Admitted to possession of marijuana with an out of state card. Worsley was held for 6 days before being released on bond: all seems up-and-up.

You fail to mention the bond. You also fail to mention that he did not violate said bond: the judge overseeing the case revoked ALL bonds he was overseeing.

You go on to mention he was arrested for failure to appear in court. This is untrue: when the bond was revoked he (and his wife) were rushing to Alabama to avoid that and he was once more arrested for possession. He was extradited to Alabama where he agreed to 6 months probation.

You next claim he violated that probation: this is wrong. A separate judge revoked his probation and sentenced him to 5 years in prison.

So this man was arrested, released on bond, the judge changed his mind and said the bond didn’t matter, arrested AGAIN and agreed to a plea deal, a separate judge decided that also didn’t matter, and given 5 years.

You then go on to say comparing this to Brock Taylor, the rapist, getting 3 months in prison is apples to oranges. That statement is correct, just not for the reason you imply.

You other posts include sharing a tweet from Byron York, the chief political correspondent for Fox News (who we all know are a credible organization who never poorly photoshop images to support their claims) of a poster he claims (or rather implies) to be on the National Museum of African American History website. Those images are not in the webpage he linked and don’t appear anywhere on the website.

Other claims you make include: “George Floyd wasn’t murdered” and “global warming is good.”

We got a real winner here. Not at all biased and fully versed in doing basic research into basically anything. Everyone else can go home, clearly this man is gonna save us all."

2020-07-17 08:16:58,archontwo,"An anecdote my black friend from Queens told me. I went to see her and she'd just got back from a trip to Scotland. She made the observation that an American abroad is different from an American at home. She was out some and someone heard here and this couple came up to her and asked if she was American. They were Texans and were overjoyed to find a fellow American in a foreign land when they couldn't understand the Scottish accent.  They talked for hours. Under normal circumstances a black girl from Queens would never have anything in common with an middle aged white couple from Texas and my friend was a little perplexed why her.  But on return to the US she had this reflection. Most Americans never leave their own state let alone go abroad. But when they do go abroad now they are not east coast west coast southern or metropolitan. They are just 'Americans' and because they've never thought of themselves like that and are insecure in a foreign land, they are attracted to any other American for moral support.


It was a fascinating observation and it was weird to me at the time as a Brit traveling around the US I didn't care who I met or was with and never have. Not in Europe or the US."
2020-07-17 07:58:59,archontwo,"More Parisians I think.  I travelled a bit round France with some friends. We were driving and hadn't planned properly out rest stops. So we came across the village inn about 2pm. It looked quite and the door was locked. But we knocked anyway. A minute or so later a woman opened the door and we asked in our broken French could we come in and have something to eat. She shook her head and said she was closed. Our faces fell and she must have seen that because she then said in broken English ""come"" and she waved us around to the back of the inn where there was her garden. She bade us to sit there and wait. We were confused but a few minutes later she came out with a tray and dome drinks and said 'you wait I get small eat' further confused she went back in the inn and came back with bread butter meats pickles tomatoes and olives and started to make sandwiches in front of us. We were blown away with such hospitality and of course thanked her profusely and offered to pay bug she was having none of it.

So yeah not all French are rude and xenophobic. Some are genuinely wonderful people who are just nice to anyone."

&gt; BUDAPEST - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday the EU&amp;#039;s coronavirus recovery plan would be unacceptable if funding were linked to rule-of-law conditions, and Budapest could veto any deal as a last resort.

&gt; &amp;quot;The EU is set to spend 750 billion euros on aiding economic recovery in member states hardest hit by the pandemic - money that Orban said should be distributed&amp;quot;fairly and flexibly.

&gt; When a liberal Hungarian EU lawmaker asked German Chancellor Angela Merkel, now holding the EU&amp;#039;s rotating presidency, on Wednesday whether the EU was prepared to condition recovery funding on adherence to democratic standards in Hungary, Merkel told the European Parliament she would engage with Orban.

So... EU people can use facebook and google. EU businesses can advertise  to them.

But their data can't be accessed in/ transferred to the US. So what?

Facebook and Google won't care - even a business in the US could still advertise to the EU. They enter their target audience demographics, and FB/ Goog return a ""count"" of users who are likely to match that. An ""estimate."" No data transferred about users. They say yes, and ads are served... to EU users. No data transferred.

That implies such standards actually exist when in reality it's quite the opposite, the US has an [anti-privacy standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_doctrine) by default.

Which makes sense in the context that the advertisement and tracking bubble also fueled most of the US's economic growth in this past decade.

Companies like Facebook and Google are economic juggernauts, they are solely built on the collection and monetization of users' data and with the mass-scale adoption of smartphones, they've now a reach to literally everywhere and pretty much everybody.

This has had very real consequences for the structure of the world wide web, which is becoming increasingly centralized; [Facebook and Google have direct influence over 70% of the internet traffic](https://staltz.com/the-web-began-dying-in-2014-heres-how.html), and that was back in 2017.

Also, yes, they do want attention, that’s how protest works. You make yourself as loud as possible, you do things that are impossible to ignore, until people have no choice but to listen.

What, did you expect them to find a nice quiet spot to protest out of everyone’s way so no one would have to pay them any mind?

There's also Bangladesh which has roughly the same surface as England &amp; Wales, but 2.6 times the population. And England is already quite crowded. These countries should have a fertility rate under 2 to say that they've done something to combat overpopulation. China has 1.68 fertility rate to have a contrast to what a not concerning fertility rate regarding big density is.

Pakistan on the other hand has 3.56 fertility rate... with 280 people per km\^2 which imo is worse than India and Bangladesh. There's also Philippines with 2.64 fertility rate with 358 people per km\^2.

On the other hand Africa has only 45 people per km\^2. They aren't yet overpopulated, but they will be if they don't keep their 4.6 fertility rate in check.

Continents that don't have a problem with overpopulation are:

\-Europe: 34 people per km\^2 with 1.55 fertility rate(that accounts Russia, even just EU there's 117 people per km\^2 with a fertility rate roughly the same)

\-North America: 18.26 people per km\^2(Canada brings it down, but even the highest is in Mexico with 65 km\^2) and a fertility rate of 1.74.

\-South America: 25 people per km\^2 with a fertility rate a little over 2 (2-2.1)

The biggest overpopulation problems at the moment are in South Asia. Haven't found conclusive information regarding Middle East's fertility rate so there may be some problems, so we might put Western Asia. Africa will become if it doesn't get their fertility rate to 2 in the next century(the most problematic being Niger and Nigeria and other Sub-Saharan countries)."

Now I just wait for you to pick one or two you don't like and say bUt ThOsE aRe Not AlL pOsitIve, or move the goalpost about sources. 

How else would you suggest addressing a gish gallop?  Isn't the entire point of providing a long poorly verified list to ensure that if ""one or two"" are shown to be false, you can still say that they're ignoring evidence?

Isn't the whole point that debunking takes vastly more work than making a claim?

For example, one of those, conservative review, is talking about Senate confirmed judges.  You're really hard pressed to say that article demonstrates ""positive effects"".

Fox news is calling the USMCA ""historic"" and ""paving the way for a jobs boom"".

Yeah.  Great jobs boom we're in now. Totally awesome. 

This is why a gish gallop was invented.

&gt;And easier example is to just read up on tye number of job ADDED during a fucking pandemic. **And the market keeps going up.**

1% of Americans own [half of us equity](https://economics21.org/stock-ownership-equity-wealthy).  The next 9% owns roughly the next 40%.  Only half of Americans own stock, and the vast majority of those own very little.  So who gives a fuck about the market going up?

The us has not added jobs.  And that ""fucking pandemic"" is something that the potus constantly is pretending will vanish. [""The virus will sorta just disappear""](https://globalnews.ca/news/7129365/trump-coronavirus-will-just-disappear/).

The guy when asked to actually lead has no fucking clue what to do. 

&gt;It doesn't even matter if you're butthurt and refuse to accept it, the rest of America is moving forward and leaving the angry losers behind. 

By... appointing federal judges and pretending a virus will disappear?  You haven't exactly made an argument for this point. You haven't really defined what criteria you have for ""moving forward"", sounds more like a platitude than a conclusion. 

&gt;""But I don't like your source, thus I refuse reality."" 

Have you considered your sources aren't the best?  That they're a gish gallop which exists to overwhelm you with quantity rather than quality?

&gt;Hey, party of science, how many sexes are there in the human race? **Can't even answer basic biology question right**. Party of science my ass. 

Oh?  You want to talk biology now?

Well, for starters, how are we biologically defining sex?  For example, how do we deal with [Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_insensitivity_syndrome) or people with Klinefelter Syndrome (XXY) who blur the lines between the binary idea of sex?  That's not even a question of gender, that's a purely biological question where ""sex"" is clearly not defined as ""either/or"".

So what prompted these questions?  How much about biological ""sex"" do you know?

Did you learn it from sources like ""the American conservative"" and fox news?

You think that might not be the best place to learn biology?"

2020-07-16 22:31:05,Langernama,"#Top EU court ditches transatlantic data transfer deal
LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Europe’s highest court ruled on Thursday that a transatlantic data transfer deal is invalid because of concerns about U.S. surveillance in a decision that could disrupt thousands of companies that rely on the agreement.

The ruling effectively ends the privileged access companies in the United States had to personal data from Europe and puts the country on a similar footing to other nations outside the bloc, meaning data transfers are likely to face closer scrutiny.

The so-called Privacy Shield was set up in 2016 by Washington and Brussels to protect personal data when it is sent to the United States for commercial use after a previous agreement known as Safe Harbour was ruled invalid in 2015.

More than 5,000 companies have signed up to it but the Privacy Shield was challenged in a long-running dispute between Facebook and Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems who has campaigned about the risk of U.S. intelligence agencies accessing data on Europeans.

“In respect of certain surveillance programmes, those provisions do not indicate any limitations on the power they confer to implement those programmes, or the existence of guarantees for potentially targeted non-U.S. persons,” the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in Luxembourg said in its ruling, which cannot be appealed.

“It looks perfect,” Schrems said.

“One of the biggest takeaways is that we would need fundamental reform in U.S. surveillance laws if U.S. companies still want to have any kind of decent access to the European market,” he told Reuters TV.

Facebook said it was studying the ruling and looked forward to regulatory guidance on its impact.

“We will ensure that our advertisers, customers and partners can continue to enjoy Facebook services while keeping their data safe and secure,” Eva Nagle, associate general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement.

Facebook’s lead EU regulator, Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon, said assessment would need to be made on a case-by-case basis.

Supervisory authorities across the EU will play a central role in allowing data transfers, and will develop a common position to give practical effect to the judgement, she said.

##‘PRIVACY TRADE WAR’
EU concerns about data transfers have been growing ever since former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden’s revelations in 2013 of mass U.S. surveillance.

The court is saying that the surveillance regime in the U.S. does not respect the rights of EU citizens and puts U.S. state interests over the interests of individuals, Jonathan Kewley, co-head of technology at law firm Clifford Chance said.

“What we are seeing here looks suspiciously like a privacy trade war, where Europe is saying their data standards can be trusted, but those in the U.S. cannot,” he said.

Kewley said the outcome could be that more customer data remains stored in Europe, which is what happened after Safe Harbour was annulled.

The U.S. Department of Commerce said it was “deeply disappointed” and would remain in close contact with the European Commission to try to limit the negative consequences of the ruling.

Judges upheld the validity of another data transfer mechanism known as standard contractual clauses (SCCs).

They are used by thousands of companies including Facebook, industrial giants and carmakers to transfer Europeans’ data around the world for services ranging from cloud infrastructure, data hosting, payroll and finance to marketing.

However, the court stressed that under SCCs, privacy watchdogs must suspend or prohibit transfers outside the EU if data protection in other countries cannot be assured.

Schrems said this meant companies that fall under U.S. surveillance laws, such as Facebook, could not use the clauses to shift data to the United States.

Facebook welcomed the decision on SCCs.

“These are used by Facebook and thousands of businesses in Europe and provide important safeguards to protect the data of EU citizens,” Nagle said.

Schrems said before the ruling that transactions by Europeans such as booking a hotel or hire car in the United States or emailing someone there would not be affected. His concerns centred more on the way personal data is stored.

Microsoft said Thursday’s rulings did not affect its customers ability to transfer data between the EU and the United States using the Microsoft cloud."

That right there is why you can't think of life as purely a statistic.

&gt; Who pays tax in a massively aged world? Who pays for healthcare for the elderly? Who looks after the elderly? Will people still be able to retire from work?

Say there is a large population drop and a high skew towards old age. It'll be a massive social change but hopefully for the better. Automation and universal income might need to be ramped up pretty quickly, and there's always soylent green as a last resort.

""This planet has – or rather had – a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy."""

2020-07-16 21:08:21,Aristocratic-Rabbit,"Your whole argument is based on the idea that only good people deserve memorials which is outright stupid as there are countless examples of statues of genocides (not a very good thing), fallen soldiers (we don't like our soldiers dead but alive) and even fucking animals.

Also you have no right to judge everyone especially if you don't know them. My grandma saved about 10 Jews (a relative big family) when the Nazis came for them. Once a year this family celebrates the date that their ancestors were saved and they always invite my family (it's hard to travel in the UK every year but we try to do so every 2 years). Yes she was racist af (which was the standard for the era), but she also was a hero for a family (they also have a photo of her in their house). Local communities are free to define their heroes (a very bad person could save a village from starvation during a drought, they have every right to consider him a local hero).

If you look closely you will never find a person that never supported something bad, but you will always find people that managed to become local heroes or create/discover incredible things. Read about the people you mentioned and I'm sure you will find a flaw in every single of them."

2020-07-16 20:16:39,Pylyp23,"It’s the truth. If you do the research it will support that statement. In my opinion it is because of a lack of education, access to technology, and radicalization from many angles in their lives from the madrassas where they are educated as youth, to family members dying from western machines and invaders, and from their religious leaders. If you look at the Muslim world outside the scope of those who live in the western world (which itself is a tiny portion of all the Muslims globally) radical jihadist imams are incredibly popular. If you actually want to read about this a good starting place would be to learn about the average Muslims views on Sharia which ties in very closely with violent jihad here:


https://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/

2020-07-16 20:11:54,OmarsDamnSpoon,"You. Don't. Give. Statues. To. Bad. People. It's not a hard concept. There are so many people who deserve statues because they improved millions of lives. Like, as another example, Marie Curie (https://www.historyextra.com/period/first-world-war/life-of-the-week-marie-curie/)

If a Flat Earther discovered a flat planet (and, for the record, they don't think other planets are flat; just ours), it'd be a monumental discovery as it contradicts our understanding of physics. It'd literally be world changing, a revolution that pushes us forward. Yes, that'd deserve a statue. No, flat earthers are not on the same level as genocide and slavery. I don't know what it is about you, but you're struggling to grasp that it's not if the person has done any bad thing; it's the severity of the bad thing itself. 

You know, the Berlin Memorial you mentioned before. If we had something like that here (preferrably not the vague shit they have), I'd love it. I honestly think that'd be a fantastic memorial to the lives lost to slavery. Those statues torn down were not that. As a newer thought, it really helps play into American propaganda to glorify these men with statues and encouraging a sort of ""sweep under the rug"" attitude about some of their actions while caring about other specific ones. We do it with Christopher Colombus, too; we glorify him and his discovery of what would later become America while flat out ignoring the literal genocide camps he set up for the farming of gold. It's likely you'd protect a statue of him, too, because that genocide stuff? Psh, everyone did that back then, but he discovered America so he's great. -_-

Your grandmother doesn't deserve a statue. If your racist grandmother got one for public display and it gets torn down, good. It's a fucking waste of stone and labour and your grandmother didn't improve the world in a grand way. She is not Edison, Tesla, Einstein, she's not a Curie, a MLK Jr; she's just an average person. I don't deserve a statue, either, nor you. We aren't great contributors. Statue-status means you did something amazing that people can benefit from in a grand way. A statue is *by design* a grand appreciation of a concept, thing, or person. You're choosing a special person to represent in all of the stone glory you can manage. 

It's a fucking problem if you only pick the racist ones whose achievement are fighting for slavery and being decent at it or founding the genocide machine we call America. You don't get a free pass for slavery, either. It's possibly the height of privilege to consider slavery and genocide something you get a free pass for because other people did it, too, back then. 

tl;dr you slow motherfucker: normal people don't deserve statues, nor do slave-owners or those who fought for slavery. Great people deserve statues. Perfection isn't required, but if your flaw was on the lines of protecting subjugation, torture, rape, murder, and enslavement of men, women, and child, you can go fuck yourself and stay in the books. You can't grow and be better than the past if you give the past free passes for being inhumane. Treat it as the problem that it is, learn from it, don't glorify it."

Save for a few naval incidents, this standoff over Crimea has been without direct military conflict, unlike the situation in eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists are fighting Ukrainian troops. But the Crimean dispute still remains tense and increasingly threatens to spill over into armed conflict over the issue of water. The decision by the Ukrainian government to cut off water supplies to Crimea in 2014 has forced Russia to spend billions of dollars on alternative supplies, but these have turned out to be inadequate. Russia is faced with the reality that Crimea is rapidly running out of water, and without some diplomatic solution, the only way to fully rectify this situation is through force of arms. Such an escalation could also again threaten the transit of Russian gas across Ukraine to Europe, which was extended for another five years in March."

It's origin is certainly not the one popularized, and in the Islamic world it's a word used with diverse meaning.  But it's use in an english context needs a lot of reform."

2020-07-16 16:29:20,PLUTO_HAS_COME_BACK,"&gt; With his new national emergency declaration, Trump aims to ensure that no U.S. or Israeli persons are brought before the international court to answer for war crimes and crimes against humanity. He cited the [American Service-Members Protection Act](https://2001-2009.state.gov/t/pm/rls/othr/misc/23425.htm), enacted after Bush removed the U.S.’s signature from the Rome Statute. The act contains the “Hague Invasion Clause,” which authorizes the U.S. military to use armed force to extricate any U.S. or allied national detained by the ICC. This provision has never been used but its ramifications are frightening....  
&gt;  
&gt; A week later, on April 12, 2019, the Pretrial Chamber apparently succumbed to U.S. pressure and [declined to authorize](https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2019_02068.PDF) Bensouda’s investigation. Although agreeing with Bensouda that there were reasonable grounds to believe that CIA members had committed war crimes, the Pretrial Chamber denied her request for an investigation “in the interests of justice.” That chamber cited the “extremely limited” possibility of an effective judicial process due to the likely refusal of U.S. and Afghan authorities to cooperate.  
&gt;  
&gt;But in a landmark decision, on March 5, 2020, the Appeals Chamber [overruled](https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2020_00828.PDF) the Pretrial Chamber’s determination and authorized Bensouda to initiate an investigation.  
&gt;  
&gt;Trump declared his “national emergency” three months later."

2020-07-16 16:23:35,Pylyp23,"No it isn't. That is one interpretation. Jihad is a core tenant of the Islamic faith and it has been defined by numerous islamic scholars over Islam's history. First it must be stated that there are two ""jihads"": against the enemies of Islam and against the sin within yourself. Here we are obviously speaking about the first. The problem is that many argue that Jihad=committing terrorist acts and, sadly, this is the only time that westerners will become aware of the term so for practical purposes in English Jihad will always have a negative connotation despite several Islamic scholars arguing only for ""peaceful"" jihad. For most Muslims in todays world they would consider the primary purpose of Jihad to fight westerners in some way. This is due to many factors that I do not want to get into but will try to if you want some clarification."
2020-07-16 16:22:56,Nethlem,"&gt; It's a meme, it's a sprawling network of conspiracies linked together really tenuously. 

Sorry, but that's just naive. There are plenty enough reasons to believe certain parts of this are pushed by [organized interests](https://www.inverse.com/innovation/bots-are-spreading-lies-about-the-coronavirus-on-social-media). 

Which is particularly obvious once you realize that the whole QAnon narrative is actually a pro-Trump narrative and thus the overlap between these two groups is rather large. Even if one would concede to it being ""*just* a meme"", the Trump camp is no stranger to ""weaponizing"" those, it's been a major factor for Trump's original popularity.

This leads to such absurd situations that even among German anti-lockdown protesters there are people who will reason for their insane actions with ""Obamagate"" and other off-topic rants about the greatness of Trump and similar QAnon garbage which is by now even beamed out in German language versions over YouTube, Facebook and other US based social media.

And while the press is quick to point at countries like Russia and China for this kind of agitation, the matter of fact is that the US, and [it's Five Eye partners](https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/), have [actually pioneered these kinds of tactics](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks)."

2020-07-16 16:19:02,DarthOswald,"You're cherry picking extremely hard. What about Palestine, or Myanmar, or Iran, or Saudi Arabia, or the further enstatement of Putin as effectively a lifelong leader of Russia, etc.

You can't just say 'well these 3 or 4 things turned out fine', it's the most ignorant take you could have on this issue.

'Good' outcomes similarly do not last forever. After WW1, I'm sure there were many like yourself offering the view that those fearing a second were only saying so because of the proximity of the last, because it was what they grew up seeing. Your reasoning adds too much weight to the idea of good things happening and too little to those bad outcomes.

And a lot of it is well based on evidence backed findings. For example when I was in university certain boards of 4chan were for the crazies and you’d read some threads. And then some of these threads talked about sex cults and trafficking and sexual assault being rampant in Hollywood. It named names and had loads of examples. Including Epstein and Weinstein stuff. And part of those were pizza gate stuff included in that. So you see when 2 of the 3 hits come true. And there is a lot of evidence supporting pizza gate. It hasn’t been debunked like the news says, because they haven’t answered the proper questions. A lot of these weaponized autists so more investigative work than journalists do. These same ones predicted BLM will lose steam and support once they start criticizing Israel. And low and behold. It’s a scary world and in the system there is always a boot on someone’s neck.

2020-07-16 10:04:03,Aristocratic-Rabbit,"&gt; You think it's racist for someone whose ancestors were enslaved because of the colour of their skin to find a statue that celebrates a man who was responsible for the enslavement of hundreds of thousands of people distasteful? That's a stretch, sorry.

Stop altering my words fucktard. I think it's racist to use someone's skin color to bolster your argument while it has no place in it, like you did.

&gt; https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-52962356

I actually read it, can't spot the quote that says ""I'm black so because my ancestors were possibly slaves I don't like the statue"". He never used his skin color as his argument, **you** did you fucking racist pig. Not liking slave traders isn't a privilege only those with higher melanin in their body have.

&gt; Assuming you're defining this protest as ""violent"", then you're contradicting yourself.

A violent protest is called a riot and it turns the public opinion against the rioters message so it's normal do increase the time it takes for a change to happen.

&gt; To remind you: your original argument was that the years people had spent peacefully protesting for the removal of the statue wasn't long enough.

Yes, it wasn't enough and the riots are making the public opinion to take even longer to change. People see riots as something negative because when it happens public property gets destroyed (which the public must pay to get fixed). Imagine destroying someone's road/park/trash bins which he might still pay for and then wondering why he doesn't support your message.

&gt; You have again moved the goalposts. The statement I was replying to was ""Democracy always works.""

Never moved anything. Democracy always works according to every democratic country I can point you to. I've yet to see a democracy fall because it didn't work, but it always fells because the majority's opinion might be swayed (like Hitler did) using the suffering of the people against them to rise in power. When someone uses a democratic way to gain power it shows that democracy works, even abusing a weakness your opposition has is democratic and that's what is happening in every debate."

From my observations the Qtips are the Trump supporters that didn't necessarily have a strong in group before all this. Usually divorced, late boomers to early Xers, or full on boomers married or otherwise. Q came along and either through strategic planning or dumb luck offered these lonely people a chance to feel like they were genuinely going to make some kind of difference while helping their leader through their research and deciphering. 

I honestly think this Q shit is going to, or at least should be, thoroughly studied for years after this. Or hell, maybe the Russians or Chinese already did the studies and this is the result. Maybe TikTok will usher in a whole new Q.2 in the years to come."

So everything can be interpreted as supporting their belief. COVID can be a deep state plot against Trump, or Trump smoke screen to save children. Any observation can then fit into one of those narrative and confirm the fundamental thesis.      

Their defense mechanism and recruiting message is ""[Do your own research. Don’t take anything for granted](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming/610567/)"" but as such, with the help of the cornucopian information flow from the internet, it ends up being ""find tibits of informaiton that can be interpreted in the sense that it reinforce 'what you know' "" in a gigantic [postdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postdiction) (sometimes called Nostradamus effect) and [Barnum effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnum_effect) echo chamber.

The truth is that most of the ""controversial"" posts in 4chan, wherevver they lay in political spectrum aren't even serious and are there just to provocate (that is to flame or troll) or for few giggles. The problem is that there are people who take that and the site far too seriously and buy into that shit. That is also one reason why nutty things are posted there, because many find it funny when right wing CT crowd etc. just swallows everything up.

So if someone has any bias towards anything conspiracy related at all they can quickly be convinced that it's all a part of a bigger scheme.

And the way their whole culture works plays a big part of it, I think. No one ever knows what's going on because ""disinformation is necessary"". You can't be told all this stuff, you have to keep digging and find out for yourself.

This is freaking brilliant to me, honestly. Because no matter what anyone ""discovers"" on their own, they're convinced their internet search led them to discover a unique truth that none of them really can articulate to each other in any kind of reality. It's just a bunch of half thought out postulated theories, followed by ""keep digging, Patriot!"" It's like a weird circle jerk where they're all cheering on and encouraging each other's stupidity."

2020-07-16 09:16:03,alexinternational,"&gt; Pople just troll there.

Most do, but not everyone. Some of them are true believers. Ironically, they seem to feel welcomed in a place where their behavior and beliefs can be mistaken for trolling. They feel encouraged to spread it further, where it reaches other isolated believers. However I feel like 4chan is not what it used to be. Even /pol/ looks more tame these days."

Plus people generally don't care unless it affects them. This is how QAnon spread out of control. I personally know the mentality behind QAnon but this was back in the old days before facebook.

2020-07-16 08:53:54,babaqunar,"A good read for anyone OOTL about QAnon.

This part tags my biggest concerns as of recently. Fuck Jihad, fuck Neo-Nazis and fuck incels.

'Most violent extremist movements see attacks or terrorism as a means to a political end. The Islamic State and al Qaeda hoped to, at various times, draw the West into military quagmires in the Middle East or to break Western countries’ resolve in order to end current engagements. Neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups want to inflict damage on Jewish, LGBTQ, and minority groups, perhaps to spark a Helter Skelter-style race war. Incels often seek revenge against women for refusing them sex and to wake up fellow disgruntled men to their cause.

While there is significant overlap between QAnon and other far-right, anti-Semitic, anti-LGBTQ, and white supremacist movements, what sets the whole QAnon movement apart is that it does not expressly seek to remake society. Instead, its followers see themselves as well-informed, law-abiding citizens who are the only ones to recognize the crime and corruption of the deep state. QAnon believers are firmly convinced that they must save the children being trafficked by Clinton, Trudeau, Martin, Hanks, and so on. To that end, bringing an AR-15 into a pizza shop where children are being kept or making an attempt on the life of one of the world leaders at the center of the conspiracy may seem like a justified and even noble act.'"

2020-07-16 08:47:05,Kimantha_Allerdings,"&gt; Wow, much racism here.

You think it's racist for someone whose ancestors were enslaved because of the colour of their skin to find a statue that celebrates a man who was responsible for the enslavement of hundreds of thousands of people distasteful? That's a stretch, sorry.

&gt; Can you please link the quote?

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-52962356

&gt; I can't and won't pretend the statue of a slave trader in a city I was born and grew up in wasn't an affront to me and people like me.

&gt; Never said it wasn't effective but the most effective way of protesting (as you can see through modern history) is the peaceful one. If you want something to change fast you should protest peacefully, if you want it to take decades of debates then riot all you want.

Assuming you're defining this protest as ""violent"", then you're contradicting yourself. To remind you: your original argument was that the years people had spent peacefully protesting for the removal of the statue wasn't long enough.

&gt; So you agree that every kind of government can be corrupted, do you also agree that democracy is the most effective one because even with a partial corruption it's capable of progressing?

You have again moved the goalposts. The statement I was replying to was ""Democracy always works."""

Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.

That's what gets me here. All these people blathering on about lost history and culture seem pretty blithely unaware of - like - the entire story of humanity. Toppling statues is abso-fucking-lutely nothing new. This is what happens when social movements of all stripes take hold. Hell, it's practically tradition. I guarantee all of them have heroes from one time or another who played roles in movements that toppled statues. 

If anything is unprecedented here, it's the breathless moaning of people upset about some folks they don't know pushing over a representation of someone they've never heard of and know nothing about - play-acting like they *really, truly* believe it's an act of some grevious harm."
2020-07-16 06:53:38,mojitz,That's right. No group in human history ever toppled a statue until *the Marxists* came along - and this certainly isn't something an enormous number of different groups with different ideologies (some of whom you probably downright celebrate today) have done throughout history.

&gt;Statues aren't history books, they don't tell a story or condemn something or teach about what someone did. Statues exist only for one thing and that is glorification.

These statues may not become history books but they certainly become embodiments of history. We shouldn't knock down our history, even if it's ugly.

“Hype train” ...people (especially POC) have been uncomfortable with racist monuments, the erasure of racism from our history (for example in high school history classes) for a long time, and the general way that monuments like that glorify the person while ignoring the misdeeds they did. I come from the south, I have experienced this. 

Just because you didn’t notice it was a movement sooner, doesn’t mean it just started. What an ignorant point of view."
2020-07-16 05:23:24,OmarsDamnSpoon,"Call me a hypocrite, I don't care. I'm not going to agree with the masses just because a lot of people are on board with something. And that memorial is not the same as a statue; these can be the same but are not always. And it's a shit memorial anyway as it's non-specific to what ""jews"" it refers to: https://www-newyorker-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-inadequacy-of-berlins-memorial-to-the-murdered-jews-of-europe/amp?amp_js_v=a3&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQIKAGwASDYAQE%3D#aoh=15948680907137&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s

Are you trying to imply that the statues being torn down are a memorial to their cruel history? That's exceptionally naive to assume. Perhaps it's different in other countries, but in America, racism and oppression are alive and well; stronger,  honestly, thanks to Trump. These are not memorials to our mistakes; these are glorifications of supposed heroes who, in some cases, only have a statue specifically because they fought in the Civil War. Sweeping the racism under the rug because that was how things were back then negates those who still carry the burden of that past to this very day. 

It's not about different opinions; it's about morally wrong ideas. Perhaps your morals are different, but I don't show monument-status respect to racists. Perhaps you'd defend a statue of Hitler because outside his Holocaust thing, he was he constructed the Autobahn and was against smoking, I do not know. I, however, don't support these things. Should they be forgotten? Fuck no, but they also shouldn't be glorified in a god damn statue. 

And I'm speaking of my morals now about my oppositional stance if I were to exist 100 years ago. If I was born back then, who knows what I'd believe (I'd probably be racist). However, people did stand against the majority back then, they did kick back against slavery. You'd still be saying they were anti-democratic by your reasoning, that they're just being dictators. This is the same stupid reasoning that caused the dumbass war in the first place. Some things aren't just about ""different opinions""; some things are just wrong. We erect statues to remember, to show honour, and to glorify a person, thing, or idea. If, out of the millions that existed, you choose to make statues of those that owned slaves, protected slavery, and fought and died for the rights to slavery...you're glorifying slavery in your statues. 

That's why they're coming down. In a time of racial strife and tension, where minorities are getting gunned down and their cop murderers protected, where the klan and nazis march with confidence, where we have video footage of cops cooperating with racists while being completely aware of who they are, you can expect racist symbols to come down. By arguing to protect them, you're fighting to protect this problematic concept. So, fuck the majority if they want to protect racism and monuments to slave owners; I don't respect oppression.

Edit: you talk about banning symbols but ignore the symbolic representation of slaveowners and soldiers who fought for slavery as monuments. That's the real hypocrisy here.

Edit 2: if we had a memorials for slaves, that'd be another thing. That's not what has been torn down. Further, this entire nation was founded on the rights of landowning, wealthy, white men. It was never equal to begin with. It was founded on the blood of native americans. It was founded on slavery and oppression. We don't have to respect a nation that still functions largely in this manner."

2020-07-16 04:20:53,OmarsDamnSpoon,"You're acting like history only exists in statues. We can acknowledge their existence and contributions in the history books, but statues are different. They are not a mark of history, but rather the glorification of these people in both the ""good"" and ""bad"" traits. Nobody is perfect and nobody expects them to be so. However, if the person supported for and fought to maintain an incredibly inhumane system, they don't deserve a statue *unless you and/or the nation supports those things*. You don't get a free pass because those times were different. If you were studying the inferiority of blacks as compared to whites to prove their subhuman status scientifically and by sheer happenstance you discovered some disease or some imaging device, you don't get to have the racism omitted because ""oh yeah, that other shit was cool"". That's cherrypicking history to your convenience. 

At some point, you're supposed to grow up and understand that certain parts of society and culture were bad and/or cruel. You don't cling to those times and you certainly don't maintain monuments to the great figures who fought to maintain the aforementioned cruelty just because they did other cool things. We can remember them in other ways, but material representation like statues carry with them a massive reputation as they are by nature incredibly selective in who they represent. There are better people to represent who didn't serve to maintain inhumane systems than the ones who did."

2020-07-16 02:09:59,x1rom,"You just blame all problems to individual politicians, and don't consider how these people get into power in the first place and why they are able to do the things they do.

About the electoral college. Yeah people in rural areas get more leverage. However thinking about individuals, each person in a rural area has more influence than someone in a more populated area. Which is quite problematic since it's opposed to democracy's fundamental principle, that every single person in a nation has equal power in politics.

Proportional voting has been working very well in Germany, which has a much larger rural population than the USA. The newer settlements in the US lead to more people living in cities or surrounding suburbs than in Europe, which has seen a gradual transition from a majority rural population. All the villages left over from that time aren't abandoned. European cities have higher population densities due to the lack of suburbs but are overall smaller.

So, what I'm trying to say is, people in cities being valued the same as people outside of cities will not cause the rural population to be completely abandoned by politicians (quite the opposite in fact). However it can cause the vote to be swayed more towards more progressive parties, since city folk likes to vote more for progressive parties. Which, if such a system were be put in place in the US, would cause it to be more similar (less conservative) to the rest of the developed world.

If the reason you're in power is that exact injustice, you don't have much choice other than uphold it."

2020-07-16 02:02:43,Caja_,"Look at a muslim majority country and tell us again how life and liberty are universal moral ideas. Slave trading, beating and abusing women, killing gays *today* Majority over there have opposite views on life and freedom of the mentioned groups. Or China, North Korea and more places on earth that do not share our morals, especially not freedom. (obligatory: not all there are people who don't murder and abuse but the pew research stats show a clear picture of how people over there think about a lot of topics like womens rights, homosexuals and there is enough video material of people being *publicly* killed and all that jazz)

It's not universal. It's generally accepted in ""the west"" that freedom and life are priviledges that should be afforded to everyone and even then not everyone in the west think so. It remains *relative* to the time and place and people you ask. There is no objective morals that are just good or bad. 

So no, you can't judge someone on todays standards and todays morals that lived in the past and not consider the morals then and there. It's honestly strange to see someone so convinced that their own morals are *the* objective standard of all that is, was and will be.

I don't know the details about this guy but he had a statue erected in his name so people *then* seem to deem him worthy of one even if you, today, don't. If enough people don't want to see it, the majority, then it still belongs in a museum as it's art and history, even if you judge it as bad. 

TL;DR: Morals are subjective and therefor relative to time, place,  indiviual asked or the average of a group. Don't destroy history."

Dude, at least half of ancient Greeks were a pedophiles (which is a Greek word) and surely we have statues of a couple of them, does that mean that we will judge them based on our modern standards? No, because they were different times with different mindset. When our military dictatorship (which was hardcore Cristian) rose to power did they destroyed the ancient Greek statues because the majority of them were homosexuals/bisexuals? No because they were living in a different time with a different mindset.

Just accept that people are humans and follow the standards of their times because those who pushed the boundaries in every field didn't gave their lives defending something that would become acceptable 500 years later but searching for stuff in their fields. Many great chemists, biologist and scientists in general were slaveowners and aristocrats, does that mean that we should ignore everything good they managed to accomplish?

Those statues weren't erected recently (except the BLM one) and by the local communities, it's up to them to vote whether they should be removed or not."
2020-07-16 01:38:12,Shorzey,"&gt;Ridiculous systems requires ridiculous solutions.

Once again, a German citizen will have no concept of the situation rural Americans are faced with.

The electoral college is a system that was intended to give rural citizens specifically moving out west back when america was formed) a voice because their circumstances are different than that of someone who lives within 3 blocks of everything they ever need in NYC.

Those urban voters who will intrinsically over power rural citizens should not dictate how someone who lives 2000 miles away, over 100 miles from the nearest city, way of life 

Federally the government has too much power and each state should be representing it self more often than they are now. Its a direct fix that was literally implemented for this exact purpose, but we as a country have strayed from it way too far.

Its why California is trying to split into 4 different states right now. Metro areas are dictating one of the largest and remote states by areas people who sometimes have never even stepped foot within 100 miles of LA

The answer to ""no more bipartisan split"" is not ""take one sides voice away and leave the other out to dry"". Its a completely stupid concept. Especially when those cities are c9mpletely dependent on rural areas for all of their infrastructure, power, materials, food, water, etc....

If you dont understand the difference between rural America and urban America than you will never understand the circumstances america is faced with and will never have a proper objective opinion on how to fix it"

2020-07-16 01:32:44,Shorzey,"&gt;I wouldn't say the problems with American democracy stop at bipartisanism. Corruption is a big problem, but is marketed as lobbyism. Gerrymandering is a massive problem which essentially makes the votes of most people useless. Also electoral college.

Corruption is because of garbage politicians being bought off. Lobbyist? Refer to corruption. If we didn't elect literal garbage cans for politicians, then it wouldn't be a problem. Money isnt the issue, its people. No one from Europe would understand or have any perspective as to what the electoral college is for, or what its trying to fix.

Our country is one of the most vast countries on earth area wise. We have states and not one United government for this exact reason. There is zero reason why San diego San Francisco and New York city need to determine what rural Montanas citizens, or literally any other rural areas citizens go about their day to day life.

Electoral college may not work as intended, but its to give people dont even hage a choice to live in the city voice. The answer is not ""just move to a city.

Seeing as there are several states larger than germany, you guys do not have any perception on the situation people deal with here.

&gt;In Kansas city (or was it Kentucky? Idk [Edit: it was Louisville]) recently a big gerrymandered district with a majority black population had only one polling station for its entire population. Needless to say, most people couldn't vote.

Okay? And? Why is that? Bad politicians enacting garbage policies and not providing for their citizens. Thats corruption. Already explained that

If you want an example as to the other direction, muara healy, my states (massachusetts) attorney General forcefully closed gun stores with police present during our pandemic response. I get reddit doesnt understand America's policies particularly well with guns, but thats essentially like shutting down grocery stores. Guns are a right.

She went to the Supreme Court and the judge literally said ""there was no reason for this except for your political  agenda"". It goes both ways. Both republican and democrats have absolute shit representatives.

Saying everything needs an overhaul is a complete understatement, money being involved is a symptom of the issue, not a cause. A politician who can be bought off is still a bad politician if money isn't present"

2020-07-16 01:22:29,Aristocratic-Rabbit,"Holy shit that's a wot...but because someone has to evaluate your effort I will read it.

Everyone in civilized democratic countries is against slavery and racism, if they support one or both of them they aren't supporting democracy because the majority is against these ideas. Symbols that genuinely could be used to push extreme ideologies (swastika, sickle and hammer) as well as hate on specific groups (Blood drop cross, red &amp; black flag) and not fucking memes (OK, Pepe the frog) should be banned.

Statues aren't always for something you're proud of. Do you think Germans are proud of the Berlin Holocaust memorial or that they would rather it never happened? A statue is not a symbol to promote an ideology or hate, it's a reminder.

You should strive to have your community raise a statue of you symbolizing something good you did for your community.

***You're a hypocrite.*** You support democracy as long as it has the same opinion as you. Democracy is about supporting the majority, even if you don't like the decision. In a democratic vote if the result you strive for doesn't come to fruition you should accept the result and then try to convince your community that you were right so in the next vote you can see what you drive for come to fruition. If you take the matter into your own hands while the majority has rejected your proposal you're a dictator that wants to enforce his opinions against a community that has a different one.

Surely, you would oppose the masses 100 years ago. Yes. Say that to yourself to stroke your ego. Just accept you will never know because you're privileged enough to live in this age."
2020-07-16 01:20:57,pikkuhakki,"15 years back, mocking homosexuals was extremely common in the western world. 70 years back, promiscuous women were seen as worthless and 250 years ago slavery was not seen as problematic. 
Even the concept of liberty didn't really arise in large until the french revolution, at earliest around the renaissance. 

I don't support having up statues of slavers, just like I don't support having statues of people that practiced other now seen as bad stuff like facism, communism or eugenics for example. I'm just saying that your previous statement was demonstrateably false. Holding people up to modern day standards is retarted. Still doesn't mean that I agree with the things they did."

2020-07-16 01:08:25,Flashflashcrash,"I don’t think we need statues of rapists and killers (not that all of these are) to remind us not to do those things. 

A statue is a commemoration for someone or something to help remember a specific period or event. I do not think we have a popularized view of the majority of what these statues stand for. As a global community, the majority fight it. 

If you want to classify them as historical, how about treating them as such? Put them in a place where they can be protected, viewed by those who want to see them, and properly provide the factual information surrounding them. We have places like this. They’re called Museums. If the majority (which I disagree with people pulling down statues, but if the area refuses to vote for that, I believe the people should remove it) vote to remove the statue, that’s exactly what should happen. 

No, I actually enjoy history to a degree. People say it repeats itself, but I think people just use old, outdated, and archaic information because it worked in the past. They aren’t creative or logical enough to create something new so they reuse old ideas because they are still accepted by fringe groups and that allows them to build a stepping stone. 

I am not wealthy by any means, but to say we (as a country/world) are in the same situation as we were during WWII is laughable. A lot of what was happening wasn’t known about in the popular news circle until after the fact. Now, we can find out about something and begin fighting it immediately. 

As for the social media comment, you’re saying the world hasn’t gotten any better than from 100 years ago? Do you really believe that? 

As far as his art being in museums, Museum of WWII in Massachusetts has a few pieces and the UK has sold/auctioned a few pieces within the past 10 years. Please, get your fucking facts straight and lose the aggressiveness, I’m being pretty pleasant. 

So, you can find his book in Greece. Where at? In public libraries, and those libraries have shelves, which house books. Guaranteed when you walk in, his book isn’t on a podium behind glass with a light illuminating it’s specialness. 

Finally, a gun was never a real person. The people depicted in the statues were. They made choices and were alive. The gun was an inanimate object and still is. That’s a silly argument."

You're a very regressive thinker. Just because it was the custom then doesn't mean we should respect it now. It was the custom of acient Greece to practice Pederasty. Would you support the erection of a statue of a man who would frequently fuck little boys if he also (as an hypothetical example) developed a primitive sewer system, or would you be put off at having a pedophile as a symbolic representation of the concepts and ideas your nation was proudly representing? 

Old and antiquated customs aren't always something to stress over, but some are incredibly abhorrent and (unless you want those concepts and ideas to represent you and your home nation) you should be opposed to statues that glorify them. I don't have to respect old racists because it was the thing back then. I don't judge them for being racist, but I do judge the erection or protection of their statues."

2020-07-16 01:01:26,OmarsDamnSpoon,"I'm judging them based on what their statue represents as well as the morals of today. Are you in support of racism? If not, are you in support of racist people and symbols representing your nation? I am very much against slavery and racism, so I was avidly against the Confederate Flag flying at the statehouse as it reflected negatively on everyone within that nation, myself included. It coming down is a symbolic step forward away from the confederate history and towards a progressive future as the removal says that we no longer proudly show a symbol of hate and oppression. 

However, we still have these statues of men who fought to maintain slavery. At my statehouse is a monument to the soldiers who gave their lives to protect their rights to suppress blacks, to treat them as inferior and sub-human, and to bind them into slavery, to be considered little more than property and machinery. I understand that this was the ideas of the time but that does *not* make it okay to represent these as the symbols we're proud of. Similarly, when other nations begin to wave or show these symbols, we instantly disconnect it from the history of their origin nation and see them as a symbolic representation, like with the nazi flag being flown here in America. Who the fuck gives a shit that it was how people were back then; it's being used today to show support and appreciation for the concepts it represents. 

I don't have a statue and I don't give a shit what people think about me in 100 years. The times change and so, too, should the symbols of a nation. As for if I'd support a vote, sure. I'm fine with that. However, I also support their being torn down; I'm not going to align with the majority of people in this hypothetical vote if they vote to support a symbolic representation of slavery. My morals do not respect subjugation as an idea no matter how many people vote to protect it. I'd've opposed the masses 100 years ago, too."

I'd also tear down a statue that honoured those that fought to protect the rights of slavery. Fuck them."
2020-07-16 00:41:42,Aristocratic-Rabbit,"&gt; I don't think that. I think that he was personally opposed to it because of his skin colour because he was quoted saying as much.

Wow, much racism here. Can you please link the quote? I'm genuinely curious about if he's racist or you're racist.

&gt; You do know that both of those things came about through protests, right? Including some very violent protests, far worse than pulling a statue down.

Never said it wasn't effective **but** the most effective way of protesting (as you can see through modern history) is the peaceful one. If you want something to change fast you should protest peacefully, if you want it to take decades of debates then riot all you want.

&gt; Right. There you go, then.

So you agree that every kind of government can be corrupted, do you also agree that democracy is the most effective one because even with a partial corruption it's capable of progressing?"
2020-07-16 00:38:26,OmarsDamnSpoon,"If the statues didn't represent such abhorrent concepts, then they wouldn't come down. History isn't being re-written nor do the statues tell history themselves (they glorify parts of it); if we want to learn about history, we always have access to books and the stores of information online. The statues themselves, however, represent concepts and ideas that are disturbing in modern society and should be removed. 

This is the same issue we have with the Confederate flag. Sure, it's a part of history. Sure, we shouldn't revise or hide that it occurred. But should it be waved at the statehouse? Should we brandish it with pride? The answer should be ""obviously not"". 

The replacement with a random protester is wasteful, but if we're coming from the angle of symbolism and conceptual representation, then this is integral to the American history; protest and revolution. No racism or status representation are shown in this statue; just the concepts we hold true to our origins. While some of the statues may represent some men who have done some good things, we can't pretend that context doesn't heavily suggest a representation of their more disgusting ideas. Their place should be in the history books whereas those who actually contributed to America (or the world) in a positive, non-selective way should be erected. I, for one, would love to see a statue of Jonas Salk for the polio vaccine *and* that he didn't patent it which resulted in it staying cheaper and affordable. That deserves a statue."

""Crippling"" sanctions will actually affect this opposition-leaning middle class disproportionately more. Most of Erdo's supporters are either really poor or really rich. The poor ones don't care, because rich party members hand basic necessities out anyway. And the rich ones, like most other rich people, won't really feel its effects. Therefore, punishing Erdo with sanctions is a terrible idea with a VERY high chance of backfiring (People tend to favor authoritarians in extreme poverty)."

2020-07-16 00:22:50,WanderingRekaterac,"The CHP has changed drastically since Erdo came into power. New factions within the CHP (and some other parties) are surprisingly pro-European, thanks in part to the youth's preferences. However, recent years have strained this already fragile relationship. Honestly, a younger leadership with less xenophobia will make things much easier, but we'll see.

For now shifting the Overton Window into the left is your best bet as a Greek person. The more intense outrage Greek people show, the more wary Turkish people will become. Same goes for us. Also, debunking their fake nationalist propaganda helps. For example, instead of going ""MY HERITAGE"" at the recent Hagia Sophia ordeal (which played into Erdo's hand), a response like ""Look at all these Ottoman artifacts we still keep; why don't you keep your end of the bargain"" would not only debunk the propaganda (which followed a weak sovereignty sentiment) but also hurt the fake conservative image of an ""inherently hateful and genocidal"" Greek person.

I know it sounds hypocritical, but it starts from somewhere. And I think when these xenophobic shitweasels lose power it will reciprocate."
2020-07-16 00:17:37,Ataraxia02,Like I said Colston was product of his time and many rich people like himself was involved in the slave trade. Obviously slavery is bad and it should be condoned however it seems like people only discuss slavery in the context of a white master and black slaves. No one is talking about black on black slavery that is happening today and it was that interaction that allowed to Atlantic slave trade to happen.

Fighting between the two nations has been sporadic since a 1994 ceasefire, but sporadic bouts of violence have popped up, with the most notable being a conflict in 2016 called ""The Four Day War"" where the Azeris managed to move the line of control for the first time since the ceasefire. This was by far the most major conflict since the ceasefire as 8-20 square km of land was captured by Azeri forces and and many lives were lose.

 The most recent bout of violence on the border started on this Sunday has only continued to escalate, as the death toll has reached 16 people, including one Azeri general. Both sides blame the other for starting the fight."

Totally agree but we don't see anyone publicly condemning what they do, only praising them.

&gt; If their actions (let’s says helping slaughter countless of innocent people and force hundreds more into forced labor) were honorable once but aren’t now, why is the statue still there?

To remind you that something bad was considered good and that you should always strive to make your society better.

&gt; Hitler did quite a few charitable acts. Does that make him a good person? Does that mean we should have a statue of him outside a children’s home? 

To have a statue doesn't mean you're a good person. There are statues of the god of death in Greece, does it mean that everyone thought he was a chill dude?

&gt; Books do change, however, properly preserved history pieces haven’t lost much to time and people go and learn about them with FACTUAL information to back it up.

History pieces like statues.

&gt; If people truly thought these statues were history, they would move them to a place where they could not only be appreciated but protected. 

Last time I checked if the public wanted something to be display something publicly they're free to do so and it's as safe as putting them in a museum.

&gt; No. The history repeating itself is a bullshit excuse. 

I see someone skipped his history class repeatedly. You could say you repeated your own history (which is kinda ironic).

&gt; We have global communication and an infinite supply of resources and communication technologies compared to those in the past.

You might have infinite supply of resources as a spoiled brad, the rest of us peasents don't.

&gt; Do you think that humanity will make no distance and better themselves? 

No. As you can see social media increased the division of people and has created echo chambers like Twitter in which everyone tries to 1up another increasing the strength of the extreme movements.

&gt; Where are his statues?

They were destroyed because they were raised by him in order to stroke his ego, not by a local community.

&gt; His art is in museums.

No they aren't. Get the fucking facts straight. They're stored and aren't visible to the public.

&gt; His book is on shelves. You have to seek those out.

Not exactly. In Greece you can find his book easily in public libraries. We like reading fucked up things so we can avoid them and that's why you can also find the communist manifesto (we had the privilege to fight both Nazis and Communists).

&gt; Finally, on the statue. You seem far to intelligent to have taken that in such a literal way, I’m going to assume you were being sarcastic and weren’t actually looking for an answer.

I was sarcastic. It's the argument ""a gun doesn't kill, people kill"". A statue doesn't oppress, people do. If you get offended/oppressed by a statue you should go to a psychotherapist."

Statues also get plenty of light when they stand in the public. You don't need to be presented with facts to know that in Auschwitz some horrific things happened. You don't need to know that a statue of a slave trader symbolizes slavery (which our society thinks it's a bad thing), but you need a reminder so you won't become like him.

I could be completely wrong but I feel like the BLM statue will ""expire"" fairly quickly like it's predecessor (or like the Confederate statues).

Seriously, almost every convenience store in a major city in Japan is now staffed by a foreigner. They might be Asian but they are most likely from Vietnam, the Philippines, etc.

""Women at a disadvantage"" has nothing to do with it. If you're a housewife you will have more kids as long as you can afford to. Nobody delays childbearing to have a career, they make babies pretty much as soon as they are married. Because not all families will make babies, or some will make one, there needs to be a lot of families making three or four babies. That's what you don't have in Japan. To have four kids in Japan is pretty much unthinkable unless you're a senior executive at a large company, or you live way out in the countryside.

The problem is that it is very expensive to live in Japan, they don't have a permanent underclass to support the lifestyles of middle-class people. Wages have been stagnant forever. People can't afford to make more than one or two kids. Same issue as everywhere else  in the world, only more concentrated.

The reason people from all around the world think Japan is so amazing is because it is (or was...) Japanese. If you want to go to a country that's full of third-worlders there's plenty of others to choose from. If you want a country where everyone is well-mannered and attractive you can't just open the gates to the riff-raff.

By the way if you look at European countries and exclude immigrants, and children of immigrants, they all have the same problem. In the 1990s France had panicked news articles talking about how they didn't have enough French people. Boy they sure solved that problem."

Greed made systemic oppression and legal enslavement okay, and it also cultivated and promoted hatred and division to make white people feel justified in their actions just like Hitler did. Black people were not just enslaved. They were murdered. Beaten. They're children were considered property. They weren't even shown the same respect as the work horses on the same plantation.

The Confederate flag you could argue it serves the same cause as a swastika for a different reason, so you could ban it.

Apple, Alphabet (Google), Dell, Microsoft, and Tesla are among the wealthiest and most powerful companies in the world. These companies purport to be green and futuristic, but their products are Powered by Blood Cobalt.

You're right, a blockade would almost certainly lead to violent conflicts. You're wrong that economic sanctions would achieve the same thing though, economic sanctions are only part of the puzzle. Modern warfare relies not on blunt measures but on measured and nuanced tactics. Crimea's little green men and China's fishing boats are all excellent examples of these measured and nuanced tactics.

* The Colston statue toppled and thrown into the river [has already been dredged out and will go into one of the museums](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-53083939). ([Bristol also has a section regarding it's role in the slave trade](https://www.bristolmuseums.org.uk/stories/bristol-transatlantic-slave-trade/), it'll likely go there)
* The original Colston plaque never referred to his own role in the slave trade, it's ironic that many have walked past it without knowing who he was or what he did before this. Talk about lost history. There was to be another plaque that mentioned his role, but the council err-d and ahhh-d over it just as the BLM protests came around.

D'you reckon Stalin, Lenin, Hitler, or Saddam Husein will be left by the wayside of history because their statues have been toppled? Another irony is Colston is actually being put into the spotlight with a reach far further than his local city, and the act of statue toppling has put his role in history into context. Prior to this, how many of you even knew his name?

The statue could be considered a bit masturbatory, but even the artist doesn't think it'll be a permanent feature. It's akin to the temporary features on the [Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square in London](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/arts-and-culture/current-culture-projects/fourth-plinth-trafalgar-square/whats-fourth-plinth-now) (coincidentally the current artist on display, Michael Rakowitz, [referred to Marc Quinn, the artist of the BLM statue, for his own inspiration](https://youtu.be/Y2Us2gCxgfk?t=36))."

'Oh, HK's been protesting for years now, remember in 2020? That was wild.' It's better to wear down resolve and interest than risk a major backlash all at once. 

You're making the very bold assumption that China doesn't have the upper hand here, because you see people protest and you see them resisting. You're making the mistake of simply forgetting that it is 27 years before they're set to take over; who is going to protest for 27 years? Against something China has the legal right to do, under international law? (retaking the city, not being a tyrannical state).

You're dreaming if you don't understand that China's already won in HK, unless there's some violent uprising or extremely wide protest like a general strike and emigration of business. Even then, difficult - more difficult than anyone is willing to attempt realistically."

&gt;Amid calls to boycott Chinese products, e-commerce companies in India like Amazon and Flipkart will display the country of origin of each product so buyers can make a better decision.   
&gt;  
&gt;The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) had asked that e-commerce companies display the country of origin on each product being sold on their platforms. The companies have agreed to the suggestion and are likely to start displaying the details of new products from August 1.   
&gt;  
&gt;This was the second meeting between the DPIIT and various e-commerce companies. Earlier on June 24, a meeting was held between officials of DPIIT and representatives of e-commerce companies which included Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal, Tata Cliq, Paytm, Udaan and Pepperfry."

Perhaps they want HK for the demonstration to citizens that theirs are the just claims to territory in Asia, in which case, it'd be a difficult situation.

I don't see China reacting anywhere near how they have been now, after HK is set to be transferred. They've committed acts of terror against their own citizens before, they can and will do it again, no matter how strong the intervention may be from the outside.

The spinless, complacent, out of touch pussies in the west would never actually threaten China in any meaningful way. Look at Germany righy now. The world doesn't always trend towards freedom and justice - you need to work for it, and we simply aren't fucking working for it."

2020-07-15 17:00:05,perfectly-imbalanced,"Ok I agree with this thought in general and would say destroying statues of people who greatly contributed to society but were racist is wrong and should first require a debate on whether the work of art should remain standing in public. However, in the case of Edward Colston, he was the deputy governor of the Royal African Company, which held a monopoly on the British slave trade. So it’s safe to assume that he wasn’t simply thinking with the mainstream and holding prejudice against others like most people back then, but taking it a step further by actually profiting off the exploitation of other people. At the very least the statue should’ve been placed in a museum with historical context explaining why it’s problematic today, why it was commissioned, and what it represented to the people of Bristol at the time"

Furthermore the world, especially the US, are dependent on China. The country was on lockdown for a few weeks on many companies ran out of stock of a variety of products cause they are all being produced in China. So if you want to shift force change in China, your first step is to get/force your companies and partners out of China. If you wanna get them of China your best bet is to impose draconic import tariffs to products produced in the given country even if they are produced by your national companies. That will increase the prices of the given products in your market and make companies consider other locations for production.

Believe it or not but Trump is getting closer to this than any other president. He might be an idiot for all it matters but dude actually started the right steps in pressuring China.

The problem here is that getting your companies out of China, supporting opposition groups and placing sanctions on the country can be / are interpreted as signs of war. The risk the US is running here is that Trump is laying the ground work for the next world war. Chinese might/is react extremely defensively and invest in their military and become more aggressive in their foreign policy in regards to neighboring countries. Especially arming Taiwan is the last step. The second Taiwan starts to seriously arm itself the next great war is already starting to roll. Taiwan having just enough capabilities to defend itself only until a third country can come to aid is the countries best defense as it makes it look non-threatening.

2020-07-15 16:04:04,x1rom,"It may be important too keep statues of famous people, but it should be noted that, in the context of statues, it is not important who those people were, or what they did, but what they represent.

Statues aren't history books, they don't tell a story or condemn something or teach about what someone did. Statues exist only for one thing and that is glorification.

And as such, we have to examine what specific statues represent, and if we want that to be glorified.

I don't know who the guy in Bristol was or what he did, but a lot of statues in the American south represent slavery, or the confederation, which itself was an entity created only for the purpose of preserving slavery.

And so, it's perfectly justified to destroy some statues, but it should be carefully considered."
2020-07-15 16:02:48,sebigrob,"Winston Churchill lead the United kingdom in it's darkest hour against Nazi Germany, and is one of the reasons the US joined the war against Nazi Germany. If the UK had capitulated, the us would have stayed neutral if not for Germany declaring war on them. Soviet Russia would have had a greater chance of falling. Winston Churchill was also a raging alcoholic, and probably a bit sexist. Having studied him, I know this. I also know how he was indeed a bit racist. Does this mean we should hate him, and overlook his achievements and contributions against Nazi Germany? Fuck no. And if you believe we should, then I don't see the point in trying to further reason with a carton of expired milk."

This could count for African warlords selling off rival tribes to white people for good money. This could count for the Arab slave trade. This could count for the serfs in russia. I'm not trying to argue the morality of the slave trade. It was a bad thing. I don't believe that it should be a reason to overlook great people of the past who deserve to be recognize for their contribution to history.

One of the biggest critiques of the EU is that it's bureaucracy has been constructed in a way that makes impossible to reform. You need every member states vote to reverse a treaty which never happens. The EU's push for coalescence  has done more to inflame fascist movements than returning to a trade-union would.

2020-07-15 15:50:11,sebigrob,"I think it's absolutely disgusting the way people are reacting to old heroes of the past. Some of these statues are of brilliant people who did not have the luxury of living in a time where people thought differently of racism, and that is a shortcoming of them. I do, however, believe that they are still brilliant people and to replace them with a protester of insignificant value to the history of a nation it for the lack of a better term retarded. We cannot hide our history. There is no such thing. Doing so will only lead to history repeating itself. We can however look at great leaders and people, discuss their achievements and shortcomings, and learn. I hate radicalist who go with the hype train and year down statues. It's revolting"

2020-07-15 15:29:58,tamsen_ikard,"At this point any kind of protest is a loss for Hong Kong. The new cold war is starting up. The west is already attacking China seriously. What incentive is there for China to give more freedom to Hong kong? Are they afraid of sanctions that are already going to be placed on them for Xinjiang, South China Sea or some other issue?   


Hong Kong was given freedoms as a way to placate the west when China and the west was playing the engagement game. China was making gestures to show that it will slowly liberalize if given economic opportunities, and the west was also under the same delusion that a rich China will be a democratic China and will accept the western world order. Hong Kong was a gesture of this relationship.  


Now that the engagement game is up, China is facing attacks anyway and has nothing to lose cracking down on Hong Kong. In fact, they lose by not cracking down. They cannot allow a city in their own land being heavily anti-China and pro-western. Hong Kong is pretty much a fifth column for them at the moment. A serious national security risk in this cold war.  


Hong Kong has to stop protesting and resisting if it wants to keep its freedoms. Otherwize, if it uses elections as a form of protest, they will lose elections completely. If they use the court as a way to allow protest, then say goodbye to judicial independence and heavy pressure to kick out all pro-dem judges. Every anti-China and pro-western action they take will cause them to lose even more breathing space.  


Let's face it. Most of them cannot leave no matter how easy the visa system gets. No country will allow millions of new migrants. Maybe a few thousand will be allowed until political pressure will build up to stop it. Even if they do leave, what kind of jobs can they take? They will not get the high paying jobs in finance in another country where there already is a network of people working on those jobs. Their only option will be to work as burger flippers and manual laborers like most migrants do. Can they accept that?  


The only option left is to stop protesting and resisting and accept the CCP as their overlords. Become like Macau. Then they will keep their freedoms and prosperity as well. Otherwize, they lose both their freedoms and prosperity and the most likely scenario for most of them will be to actually migrate to the mainland to seek work."

2020-07-15 15:00:33,tamsen_ikard,"Low birth rate was inevitable in the modern world. In the past, agriculture was the main focus for everyone and you needed more people to do manual labor. Another big incentive was high child death rate. In the past people also did not have a social safety net system or ample financial savings. There was no one to take care of you in your old age. Now all of these issues have been solved and there is nothing stopping people from having a childless life.  


You get to pursue your own enjoyment and dreams without having to spend many many hours taking care of children who will someday walk away and start their own life anyway. What's the point in taking all this hardship with no return?  


This death spiral will continue until there is enough political pressure to solve this. The only way it can be solved is through heavy government penalties. Having children will have to be as mandatory as doing the military service or paying taxes. Only when there is a strong penalty will people give up on a life full of entertainment and fun and have a children or two to take care of."

2020-07-15 12:07:54,Ynwe,"Going to be really interesting how  things play out in the long term... Most of modern society cannot survive without having a younger population supporting the older population. If we don't go back to families taking care of seniors (unlikely) then the pension schemes cannot fail or we enter a humanitarian catastrophe. Thus I wonder if in the long term, countries will just accept a large foreign population to keep the native population afloat. countries like Niger still have an insane growth rate and an average population age of 15. Theoretically one could import a large number of young people and have them bolster the work force. 

That this isn't desirable for most nations is clear. However I wonder what alternatives there truly are. will be interesting if we truly see the populations of nations like Spain and Japan half by 2100 as predicted in the article."

How many Christian, Buddhist or Hindu majority countries can you name that are not secular and liberal societies? Zero.

Generally not in an oligopoly market (look into the linked demand curve on why this is the case) and definitely not in a collusive one where they’re all ensuring maximum profits.

&gt;	The customers themselves, upon experiencing the effects of treatment, decide whether it was effective or not and act accordingly. 

Not if they’re dead and already handed over all of their money

&gt;	Once again, docs with the most dead people get the least customers 

Faith healing has been disproved time and time again and shown to be actively dangerous yet people still believe in it because they’ve been brainwashed/sold a lie for so long that they really can’t help themselves.

&gt;	You can try and get whatever they gave you to a lab you trust to see what’s actually in it.

Because every regular, desperate person has access to a full labs worth of equipment and the money to pay them to run some tests. And what if they don’t actually give you a drug, just do some faith healing? 

And what of those who do not seek treatment for themselves? Who’s parents go to church for them as a baby to get healed by God? Whose family take them to a quack because a real doctor can’t help them at the moment and they get poor treatment?"

This would inevitably put pressure on them to take public opinion into account, unlike Carrie Lam who is completely unanswerable to the public. And the nomination process could have been further reformed over time.

The collapse of the 2014 reform proposal also had the bad effect of convincing Beijing that concessions are not worth offering. Which means that now, no matter how much people protest or even how much foreign pressure gets applied, Beijing will not back down on the Hong Kong issue.

Maybe the other roads not taken were also dead ends. We can debate that. But it is hard to argue against the conclusion that the road that was actually taken definitely was a dead end for Hong Kong democracy."

&gt; The JCPOA was agreed in 2015 between Iran, the US, China, Russia, Germany, France and the UK.It provided Iran with sanctions relief in exchange for the curtailing of its nuclear program, and guaranteed international agencies access to nuclear sites in the country to verify their accordance with the deal.

That's what I meant about the two sides simply not trusting each other, making compromise or even negotiation impossible.

2020-07-15 05:37:08,joker_wcy,"&gt;Hong Kong had 23 years to pass the national security legislation mandated as by the Basic Law, and many of the previous draft proposals were much more reasonable and less draconian than the law Beijing has now imposed. But the HK drafts all got dropped because the opposition (democratic) movement does not trust the government at all, so it refused to entertain any form of national security legislation no matter what the contents.

There was a bill proposed by the government in 2003. Government sponsored bills only require a single majority in LegCo to pass (as opposed to primate member's bills or lawmaker's amendments to government sponsored bills which require majority in both geographical constituency and functional constituency), and pro-Beijing camp has always had the majority in LegCo since 1997 (due to functional constituency). So even though all members of the pan-dem were opposed to the bill, they had no power to stop it, just like many other government sponsored bills. However, the bill didn't pass because Liberal Party, a party of the pro-Beijing camp, also voted against it. Since then, the SAR government has never proposed a bill regarding national security, even though it only requires a single majority to pass. But yes, I'll put the blame on pan-dem for their inability to compromise.

&gt;Likewise, in 2014 there was a proposed reform for a limited form of election for the chief executive, which the democratic camp rejected because they thought it was half a loaf. They even turned vehemently against some of the older members of the democratic movement who had argued that half a loaf was okay for the time being, and could be improved on later. So the reforms were withdrawn, and we'll probably never again see any Beijing-backed proposal with that many concessions. Again, the problem was zero trust between the government and opposition, and an inability in the democratic camp to compromise.

The CE election right now is voted by a 1200-member electing committee (often fewer because some members are representing twice), and a person requires one-eighth of the committee (150 members) to nominate to become a candidate. In the 2014 propsed ""reform"", the electing committee would be transformed into a nomination committee, but a person would require half the committee (600 members) to nominate to become a candidate. So general public could choose between CY Leung and Carrie Lam, but not someone from the pan-dem camp. China could then say they have fulfilled the promise of democratic reform in HK, and no more reform in the future. But again, I'll put the blame on pan-dem for their inability to compromise."

China has changed it's political model multiple times over the last century, and I have few doubts they will again. I'd like to hope that they become more liberal and democratic, but time will tell.

I also hope that the USA will also become more liberal and democratic, and time will tell there as well. The Trump issue will pass, but the divisions that remain in the nation won't go so easily or so fast, and neither will the depressing percentage of the population who are anti-science, anti-education, white nationalist, pro-empire, religious and racial bigots etc who put Trump in place and will do so again if given half a chance"

2020-07-15 02:12:53,atomic_rabbit,"There were many missed opportunities for compromise. Hong Kong had 23 years to pass the national security legislation mandated as by the Basic Law, and many of the previous draft proposals were much more reasonable and less draconian than the law Beijing has now imposed. But the HK drafts all got dropped because the opposition (democratic) movement does not trust the government at all, so it refused to entertain any form of national security legislation no matter what the contents.

Likewise, in 2014 there was a proposed reform for a limited form of election for the chief executive, which the democratic camp rejected because they thought it was half a loaf. They even turned vehemently against some of the older members of the democratic movement who had argued that half a loaf was okay for the time being, and could be improved on later. So the reforms were withdrawn, and we'll probably never again see any Beijing-backed proposal with that many concessions. Again, the problem was zero trust between the government and opposition, and an inability in the democratic camp to compromise.

Without drawing any moral equivalence, it's easy to see why the Xi government (which is much more hard-line anyway than its predecessors) would decide that enough is enough; if compromise is impossible, they will just impose their will on Hong Kong."

3. Once again, docs with the most dead people get the least customers (considering areas of specialisation) and thus have to re train or review their method. Dead people because of mistreatment sometimes happens, regulation or not.

China has spent the last 30 years investing massively in technology, infrastructure, education, science, R&amp;D, its middle class etc. Its brought over 300 millions people from poverty into a middle class, it has free public healthcare for everyone, its graduating ***twice as many***  engineers and STEM graduates as the US and those graduates are now world class whereas even 10 years ago they were crap.

Meanwhile the US education system continues to slide in international rankings, its infrastructure is rotting, its middle class has been completely hollowed out, its political system is fairly corrupt to the core by greed and wealth, its ""health"" system is an international embarrassment, and its primary investments have been in corporate profits and ***not*** in people.

Almost irrespective of the current Cold War, China has invested in its future and continues to grow, the US has invested in its corporate elites, and continues to rot.

Its pretty simple to see that wearing a mask cant stop a virus or places like China and Korea who have been wearing masks for a decade now would have zero virus cases. It doesnt work, youre being sold an idea and youre being told you need a vaccine for something that mutates by the week and has dozens of strains by now. Just to head your dumbass off, im not an antivac crazy either, polio, mumps, measels, things that actually kill or debilitate you, should have vaccines. If vaccines worked for diseases that change so quickly, we would all get our once a lifetime flu vaccine like we do for Polio, and it would go away. You can NOT vax for a disease this hot. you need herd immunity.

Now if im the CEO of a Medical corporation, and I can sell each person a vaccine that theyll have to get again next year for $90, and theres 300 million people who the watch the Media outlet I also own says should buy it, and im a sociopath billionaire, sounds like a good money making scheme to me. And the entire time I can act like the good guy and like im trying to help, when you fools are just buying a high tech snake oil.

Im not paranoid, im educated, well off financially, and not stuck in the societal-economic rut youre probably in. I want to help people understand that society is a place where the same people who pay majority of americans you sell you all your goods, and they can make sure you use your entire paycheck at the stores they want you to use. They pass bills to allow them to dodge taxes, they inflate the dollar devaluing your wallet while increasing their equities. Its a really simple pyramid scheme if you are smart enough to see it and wise enough to admit youve been taken advantage of, but youre not there yet.

In the mean time ill enjoy the benefits of being a few steps ahead of the mass public. I made a nice nest egg off COVID, while yall were panicking and buying toilet paper, I was looking at the numbers not the news. Good luck my fellow American. I hope people see that youre playing an MMORPG called life, and it was owned by the rich and the large market was cornered before you or I got here.

The dollar is about to have a revaluing, and gold and silver has already skyrocketed since I bought a few months ago at $12 an once. in 3 months after I sell my large sum for 25+$ an once, Illl come back here and remind you why I am rich and you probably are renting and living paycheck to paycheck the way the government wants its model citizen to."

No, I stand by my initial statement. Hong Kong is lost to democracy baring a US invasion which wouldn't be a good idea for anyone involved.

Belgian virologists have gone out of their way to explain that we count differently and that demographics play a role in these figures. So, the figures are overestimations relative to other countries. Our healthcare system has never been swamped like it has been in for example Italy, where deaths skyrocketed during those periods of undercapacity.

And besides, it's an odd suggesting you're making. It's not like Belgium runs the EU, it merely hosts it to a great extent. All member states run it. If you're unhappy about something the EU does, you would be more correct to blame everyone including your own country"

But it doesn't really matter for China and Huawei. They should have known that they cannot rise to the top without a big fight even if that fight is economic.   


The challenge that the west wants to make to China is, Can you keep growing ever stronger without US/European market and technology. That is why there is so much talk about decoupling. The west thinks China will not be able to grow without western market or tech or access.   


China cannot become a superpower while being under western order. They have to create a new order. A new financial system, a new alternative series of companies and tech infrastructure, hell even a new mobiile OS.   


So, the decoupling in a sense is the start of that process. If China cannot use western tech or rely on western market. It will have to focus on other markets in latin america, africa and asia.

Although it feels further away, the EU is definitively democratic (although there could be improvements). Outbreaks should be locally managed, but there should be a better coordinated response and supply chain, standardization, and share of information. 

Belgium is not the seat of the EU, all EU representatives go there to represent the EU, it is not like the EU is governed by Belgium. Belgium is hit pretty badly, but they count every case with a bit of Corona as a Corona case, different than other countries."

CAA has everything to do with refugee immigration, because it's giving citizenship to refugees who immigrated to India from neighboring countries. This law does not affect a single citizen of India in any way, Muslim or not, even after the application of NRC.  
  
Second, EVERY SINGLE COUNTRY has a list of all it's citizens,  and has detention centers to hold illegals(you're delusional if you think no country has them, even Canada, New Zealand and Australia) and standards of who can become a citizen.  
  
Even India is easier to immigrate to than the Canada you seem to have a hard-on for, which is why people are immigrating to India to escape Islamic persecution. You might consider it fashionable to hate India and spread hate about it, but guess what, the majority of us don't.  
  
EDIT: If it's so much better for people to immigrate to Canada than India, then why are millions of Bangladeshis entering India instead of flying off to Canada in their yachts and private jets lmao."

My view is coloured by being a European who has lived in the US for too long (and questioning returning) and thinking a clusterfucked pan European system would still be preferable to the on the ground reality in the US.. especially if not traditionally employed in something that I increasingly see as a modern take on feudalism.

2020-07-14 10:41:59,Langernama,"#Parliament wants a European Health Union

* Affordable access for all to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments

* Stress tests of healthcare systems in member states urgently needed

* Create an EU Health Response Mechanism to fend off future pandemics

**COVID-19 has highlighted the need to give the EU a far stronger role in the area of health, MEPs say in a resolution on the EU’s future public health strategy.**

In a resolution adopted on Friday by 526 votes to 105 and 50 abstentions, the European Parliament sets out the principles of the EU’s future public health strategy post-COVID-19.

MEPs underline the need to draw the right lessons from the COVID-19 crisis and engage in far stronger cooperation in the area of health to create a European Health Union. This should include common minimum standards for quality healthcare, based on urgently needed stress tests of member states’ healthcare systems to identify weaknesses and verify that they are prepared for a possible resurgence of COVID-19.

The resolution calls for a European Health Response Mechanism to be created rapidly to respond to all types of health crises through better coordination and management of the strategic reserve of medicines and medical equipment.  The upcoming EU pharmaceutical strategy must contain measures to make essential medicines more immediately available in Europe. Diversified supply chains need to be put in place to guarantee affordable access at all times.

The new dedicated 9.4 billion EUR [EU4Health Programme](https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/funding/docs/eu4health_factsheet_en.pdf) is strongly welcomed and MEPs believe that long-term investments and commitments are needed. They request the establishment of a dedicated EU fund to improve hospital infrastructure and health services.  On top of that, the European health agencies [ECDC](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en) and [EMA](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en), as well as joint health research, must be strengthened.

With the COVID-19 crisis ongoing, MEPs also reiterate their call for affordable access for all people worldwide to future COVID-19 vaccines and treatments as soon as they are available.  Joint EU procurement must be used more systematically to avoid competition between member states when public health is at stake.

**Background**   
Primary responsibility for public health and, in particular, healthcare systems lies with the member states. However, the EU has an important role to play in improving public health, preventing and managing diseases, mitigating sources of danger to human health, and harmonising health strategies between member states.

Parliament has consistently promoted the establishment of a coherent EU public health policy and in a [resolution on the post-2020 EU budget revision and economic recovery plan](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/priorities/eu-response-to-coronavirus/20200512IPR78912/parliament-eu27-need-EU2-trillion-recovery-package-to-tackle-covid-19-fallout), MEPs insisted that a new stand-alone European health programme should be created.
 
The Commission has since presented a proposal for 9.4 billion EUR [EU4Health](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20200525IPR79715/eu4health-meps-welcome-proposal-for-dedicated-eu-health-programme) programme for 2021-2027 as part of the [Next Generation EU recovery plan](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/priorities/eu-response-to-coronavirus/20200513STO79012/covid-19-the-eu-plan-for-the-economic-recovery).

You can’t just murder everyone. And you also can’t fight and beat an invisible enemy. Normal every day people with guns resist, fire some rounds, shoot at some troops/police, and disappear back to their normal everyday lives. And lots of people will do it when threatened by a tyrannical government or occupying force. That’s why you can never truly “win”. 

You can identify and take out “leaders”, you can take out any target that you want, but a resistance on home ground doesn’t just die, even without organization or leadership, as long as it is armed.

On home turf, the idea isn’t to shoot down drones with bullets, obviously. It’s to infiltrate or threaten drone operators. There’s lots and lots of options when you have guns."

If you want to curtail the CCP you do it by curtailing their access to the seven seas, and they know it. It's why they've been building up their blue water navy for years now. Curtail their access to the seven seas and quickly (read months not years) shut off their access to capital and resources then watch the population revolt. It's dark, it would push millions into poverty, but it might just save the rest of the world from the CCP.

While we're on this topic we need to discuss a very real, and perhaps difficult, question though: Is western governance really any better? The USA has done a great many horrible things and we can draw lines from virtually everything China is doing today to a major historical event in the USA [be it the burning of Tulsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_massacre), the [interment of the Japanese](https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/japanese-relocation), the [release of syphilis in the mid-west](https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm), the [creation and deployment of inescapable dragnet surveillance technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_%28surveillance_program%29), [debt-colonialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_American_debt_crisis)...

The separatists are a little like children. Throwing massive screaming tantrums and attracting a lot of attention. 

loudest voices in the room.

But they were *never* a majority. 

Polls have always shown under 50% support no matter who takes them. 

And Basque separatism was much the same but also contained the use of terrorism which much like in northern Ireland is unacceptable. 

Just because you have an idea doesnt mean you can bully the rest of us into going with the separatism. 

Even when they tried to have the illegal referendum, I knew no one who attended. People who wanted to stay didnt participate. Same as the illegal one in crimea.

*That* is the problem. 

If the Basque region or Catalonia had a referendum tommorow they would be voted down. They are also not being oppressed. A few people (who are racist) are angry that they dont live in a country that is soley for Basques or Catalans.

Sure Trump is responsible for some harm as every public face is, but keeping him accountable because you don't like him while turning a blind eye on everyone that you like it's hypocritical.

You're technically correct, but no [the majority of Utah is corona free](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/us-map) as well as Montana, while I agree that places which have cases should have a form of lockdown (stricter if they have more cases) there are definitely places which are under lockdown and have 0 cases.

Science around the virus isn't conclusive but we know the infection rate is minimal on kids, as well as they are asymptomatic and have low transmission rate on adults. The organ damage is from a study on adults if you read it carefully. Also one study, nothing conclusive. Should we shut down our education system because a study was made? There are many cases of studies been debunked a couple weeks later."

Now when is he promoting internal division? All I hear in his rallies is ""us"" and ""Americans"", not them. Every time I heard him talking about the far right he throws them at the same bus as far left, but he is focusing on the far left before they are more active (which is logical). 

When did he promoted racism? I think that racial segregation laws which are promoted by the ""Democrats"" (I fucking hate that this word is used by the same party from which some members founded KKK) like the ""affirmative action"" that California proposes (which allows universities to discriminate based on race) are far more divisive and racist.

This is not a conflict they can win.  Firstly, unlike the American populace, they are unarmed.  Secondly, it's one city versus an entire nation.  Thirdly,  the Chinese government is an autocratic dictatorship, they won't possibly buckle under the bad publicity and moral outrage like a western democracy might, because their officials don't face re-election in two years.  They'll just repeat Tiananmen Square a dozen times over, if needed.

I hate to be fatalistic about it, but unless you're willing to commit American boots on the ground, kill millions of mainland Chinese, overthrow the Chinese government by open warfare, and completely crash the global economy for the next twenty years by utterly destroying the industry of the world's largest manufacturing base, Hong Kong is lost."

2020-07-13 22:37:49,CreamMyPooper,"I dont know exactly how the CCP is set up, and I've heard it's a bit of a far cry from traditional communist beliefs, but dont they already have a system based, even loosely, on a western foreigner's beliefs anyway? Marx obviously wasn't Chinese.

I could be incredibly wrong but communism is still a concept of the ""white man"". Unless China has developed a new system, I cant comprehend how the Chinese decide that defending communism is a positive nationalistic action because it's still reinforcing a perspective originating from western thought. It might be a stretch, but I dont think it's too much to assume that China's attitude towards democracy is a reaction from how the west manipulated China in the past and are still fearful that it might happen again. Accepting even a morsel of democracy or western culture results in a phobia of the west and might feel anti-China because it's the same culture that fucked them over before and Hong Kong has almost acted as a proof that China would still thrive if they accepted that system. If China's intentions are to prove that they're better off than western countries, then dismantling Hong Kong at all costs is a necessity in achieving that goal.

I have a very limited knowledge on this so any corrections would be appreciated."

2020-07-13 22:30:10,Khraxter,"&gt;For example you never hear of such problems in Japan because immigrants are effectively nonexistent there. Such a ""more peaceful state"" is appealing to many.

Except those protest in France were rarely related to immigrants (at least, recently immigrated people), and also, that you don't hear about them doesn't mean they don't exist. Also, you admit yourself that you think half of the incident you cited are related to labour. How is that linked to immigrants ?

&gt;You have not read my comment, i said its the only thing many people can see, not that its the only thing! If you ask your average citizen he will be hard pressed to name more than cuisine. That's because the benefits of immigration are more intangible cultural and intellectual achievements from the exchange of ideas between people of different backgrounds which breeds new innovation. But that is hard to grasp or even explicitly point out. Your average voter does not see this.

Ok you might have a point here, but you were kind of pointing fingers in your first comment.

2020-07-13 22:25:10,tamsen_ikard,"The problem with this article and many like it that they assume China will automatically stop growing because of all of these so called problems. The usual excuses given are slowing growth and aging population. I feel this is just pure wishful thinking. This is the same China collapse crowd that have been predicting a China collapse or stagnation since 1990s.   


People who write things like this don't want to take tough action or imagine China as being a superpower. So, when you don't want to fight and don't want to lose, what do you think? You think your opponent will lose automatically.  


Even if China slows down, there is no guarantee it cannot become fast again. Plenty of countries have slowed down for a few years only to grow fast again. Even if China never grows 10% again, it doesn't matter. If it grows at 5% for 50 years it will become 2-3 times bigger than US in GDP and still be poorer than US. If its poorer than US that means labor in China will be cheaper, products will be cheaper to make. So, it can gain more and more market share from other rich countries. So, it can keep growing until this imbalance is gone.   


Second problem it mentions is aging society. If the CCP can force people to stop having babies, what is stopping them to force people to have babies?  


Just make a forced 2-3 child policy. Fine anyone that doesn't have that many children or tax them heavily. Make promotion in jobs conditional to having the right number of babies. These are policies China has already implemented to stop people from having babies. It can use the same policy in reverse.   


Another point is immigration, as China grows richer, people from poor countries will go their to get more jobs. This is inevitable. If countries like Malaysia that is not that rich has lots of foreign workers from poor countries like India and Pakistan, nothing is preventing them from also going to China.   


Arab countries are perfect example that you don't need to have permanent family based immigration to have workers. You can enforce tough rules to keep foreign workers temporarily. Prevent them from coming with a family and eventually they leave after making money.   


China will not collapse because of wishful thinking. If US and the west is serious about stopping China's growth, then it will have put crippling north korea style sanctions and cut off completely. Only with actions that takes a lot of sacrifice will contain China. Not wishful thinking."

2020-07-13 22:19:41,WrongPurpose,"From Wikipedia:
=====================
005: 2005 French riots, a series of riots that occurred in the suburbs of Paris and other French cities involving the burning of cars and public buildings at night.

2006: 2006 youth protests in France, riots resulting from opposition to a measure set to deregulate labour in France.

2007: 2007 Villiers-le-Bel riots, riots in the Val-d'Oise department that began following the deaths of two teenagers whose motorcycle collided with a police vehicle.

2007–09: 2007–09 university protests in France, protest movements resulting from several reform projects under Minister for Higher Education and Research Valérie Pécresse.

2009: 2009 French riots, a series of riots that occurred on Bastille Day (14 July) in the commune of Montreuil, an eastern suburb area of Paris.

2013: 2013 Trappes riots, riots that broke out after police arrested a man who assaulted a police officer who tried to check the identity of his wife wearing a Muslim veil

2014: 2014 Sarcelles riots, a pro-Palestinian protest against the Israeli ground invasion of Gaza degenerated into an antisemitic riot in Sarcelles, France.

2016: 2016 French taxi driver strike, a strike by taxi drivers in several major cities against Uber, a transportation network company, included many road blockades, fires, overturned vehicles, and the blockade of roads leading to the two major airports in Paris.[8]
2016: Nuit debout, protests that grew out of opposition to proposed labor reforms.

2017: Protests started following accusations a police officer anally raped a young black man with a baton.[9] Anti-police protests continued well into March 2017 when migrants were met with resistance from Paris residents.

2017: During May Day protests in Paris, a group of about 150[10] hooded demonstrators disrupted the march, throwing ""Molotov cocktails, firebombs and other objects at the police near Place de la Bastille.""[11] These ""violent protesters, who did not carry any union or election paraphernalia, appeared to be from the same fringe groups that have targeted anti-government protests in the past.""[11] Riot police responded with batons and tear gas.[11] Six police officers were injured, two of them seriously, by petrol bombs.[12]

2018: Ongoing Yellow vests movement (French: Gilets jaunes protests) over dissatisfaction with wealth disparity and ongoing increases to fuel taxes.

=====================

So around half of that is race related from a first glance, the other half labor related, in proud french tradition which is awsome. I never said that France is on the verge of collapsing, it is definitely not, but you also agree that everything is not great. And that's what i meant. For example you never hear of such problems in Japan because immigrants are effectively nonexistent there. Such a ""more peaceful state"" is appealing to many.

You have not read my comment, i said its the only thing many people can see, not that its the only thing! If you ask your average citizen he will be hard pressed to name more than cuisine. That's because the benefits of immigration are more intangible cultural and intellectual achievements from the exchange of ideas between people of different backgrounds which breeds new innovation. But that is hard to grasp or even explicitly point out. Your average voter does not see this.

To the topic of Germany, well, from the German Center for Education (which is a federal governmental foundation collecting and providing material for schools and universities in germany) (https://www.bpb.de/gesellschaft/migration/kurzdossiers/157035/eu-internal-migration):

=====================

""Several countries in the heart of Europe, including the United Kingdom and Germany (cf. contribution by Engler/Hanewinkel), have shown a current increase in immigration from Southern Europe. In particular, young people from Greece, Spain, and Portugal who cannot find work in their home countries are immigrating (cf. contributions by Engling and González-Martín). In media reports they are already being referred to as the “new guest workers” (Völker 2012). In contrast to the Southern European labor force that were recruited into many Central and Northern European countries from the 1950s to 1970s, however, these “new guest workers” are predominantly highly qualified and already have experience to some extent in inner-European mobility (e.g. through stays abroad within the framework of the EU-sponsored ERASMUS program). Their immigration is perceived positively in states like Germany which struggle with a lack of qualified employees in several regions and branches.""

=====================

As long as youth unemployment in southern Europe stays high, this trend has and will continue. Do you thing this is a good thing for countries like Italy or Spain which both also have just 1.35 kids per family? The old stay, the young leave, i would call that bleeding those countries dry. In the same time, no one can blame any of those young people using the EU open borders to find better job opportunities for themselves.

2020-07-13 22:19:33,Direwolf202,"Not quite. It really depends on the who and where, with that example, as there is also racism in India (it is just not as much of a focus as it is in the US).

My point is more about people who have a background that is not entirely constrained to India - it doesn't matter that their family partially comes from Europe or Africa or somewhere, it matters much more if they are Hindu. Contrast this with the Nazis, or with racism in the west, where total ethnic purity was demanded. According to Hindu nationalism, one needs to express total ""Hinduness"" (whatever that vague and difficult to define quality actually is)."

If EU had a central government they would do the same, because Greece that currently has 30 cases each day can't have the same restrictions as UK or Spain."

China’s rise really began to accelerate under Bush, and he did nothing because he was preoccupied with “the war on terror.” Then The Obama administration didn’t really do anything either, because it wasn’t seen as a priority.

On the other hand, I think The US alliances in the Indo-Pacific have degraded over Trump’s almost 4 years in office, partially because of his rhetoric and his unpredictability, which doesn’t exactly put us in a great position for coalition building."

&gt; WASHINGTON - The Trump administration escalated its actions against China on Monday by stepping squarely into one of the most sensitive regional issues dividing them and rejecting outright nearly all of Beijing&amp;#039;s significant maritime claims in the South China Sea.The administration presented the decision as an attempt to curb China&amp;#039;s increasing assertiveness in the region with a commitment to recognizing international law.

&gt; Last week, China angrily complained about the U.S. flexing its military muscle in the South China Sea by conducting joint exercises with two U.S. aircraft carrier groups in the strategic waterway.

&gt; China claims almost all of the South China Sea and routinely objects to any action by the U.S. military in the region.

They will not want to follow the western way. They will want their own way. They will say, why should we follow foreigners when we are perfectly capable of coming up with our own system and own culture.

India is also the same. As they get more stronger, they becoming even more hindu nationalistic. They are shunning western values and want their own system.

If they delay and China keeps growing stronger in GDP and military, then Taiwan's chance of declaring independence or changing the constitution will be even more constrained. China is expected surpass US GDP nominal by 2030 and even get to double US GDP by 2050. If that happens then China will have the money to develop a massive military that will surpass US.

But now that its evident that China will follow its own path and never accept the western world order, Hong Kongers cannot continue to be under the same system.  


This then comes to today when it is impossible for China to continue ruling hong kong without heavy repression. Hong Kongers cannot continue living under China when there is so much suspicion about CCP.   


This is the sad but slow death of Hong Kong. They will continue to rebel in any open space. China will also continue to take more and more hardline measure to control them.

You can spam as many Tomahawks as you want from your fancy ships, but the will for those middle easterners to fight for their home is stronger than anything you can throw at them - short of an all out genocide.

Hmm lets see...the US did absolutely nothing on Crimea or the downing of a civilian plane from the Kremlin. Again, nothing with Hong Kong. If you backed up your talk, you would provide asylum for much of the protestors not eligible for the bespoke U.K. VISA. How you're (and we as Canada) are so buddy-buddy with Saudi Arabia, despite what they're doing to Yemen civilians. Y'all need to google some ""yemen famine"" and see what the West is doing. You never hear about this shit though, cause money talks.

And as for US-Canada relations; you make us (Canada) arrest some Huawei exec, shove a new NAFTA down our throats, then threaten with more steel tariffs the day after. Ahh what was it? Citing uhh....""national security"". Your country's government seems to throw it's allies and relationships under the bus pretty quickly if that means just a bit more Wisconsin milk can be sold.

\*shrug\* Seems to me the US is doing nothing but padding the accounts for private sector interests over the past 20 years and playing really bad geopolitical chess. For better or worse, U.S. hyper hegemony is waning quickly, and along with global opinions on your country. The U.S. should probably focus on itself for awhile (isn't that what Trump campaigned on?) and fix a lot of internal problems, both at grass root levels and in Washington D.C. before it starts being ""Captain America"" for the world again.

All this time I thought you guys knew what you were doing, and in the context of ""good morals"". But like an saying in the White House goes....fool me once...shame on you. Fool me...you can't get fooled again."

However, the deal is basically doomed without US participation. The corporations enjoy special privileges, and access to a large market by doing business with China. If they were to do business under the TPP, they would want special privileges with access to a large market in the US. Without US participation, there is literally no reason for multinational corporations to stop doing business with China.

The US and China are both sides of the same card, as both are beholden to corporate interests. Most of the world sees the US as a greater threat due to its military presence in every corner of the globe. China is an oppressive regime, but is not a military superpower. 

It mainly gains influence through business, and the corporate interests that control politics in the West will lose money if the US takes an aggressive stance against China. The TPP was just Obama trying to incentivize the corporations to do business in a way that aligns closely with the greater geopolitical interests of all the corporations in the US."

Did the US slaughter 10,000 student protesters and then repeatedly run them over with tracked vehicles so their 'bodies' could be washed away? Nope. Does the US maintain 5, 200,000 person internment camps where an entire people are being forced to forget their culture and history? Nope. Does the US actively have agents all over the world stealing IPs and Copyrighted works so that they may make a rip-off version and claim it's theirs? Nope.. anymore. Does the US send assassins after US citizens abroad who speak out against the government? Nope. Does the US harass all of their neighbors and threaten annexation and ""punishment for their crimes"" for simply wanting access to water ways that are already theirs? Nope. Does the US hide and fail to inform the world of a highly contagious virus for several months after something was detected? Nope. Does the US neocolonize African nations by making their governments so economically indebted that the only way to pay off the loans is to kneel to every demand? Nope. Does the US forcibly relocate black people due to racist virus fears? Nope. Does the US harvest prisoners' organs without consent? Nope. Does the US purposely target semi-spiritual groups because people like them more than the government? Nope. Did the US starve 45 million people in the name of ""economic progress""? Nope.

The US does a lot of shady and horrible things, but we don't ever cross the lines China does. Better of two evils? We're talking about a murder compared to satan himself. Yeah they're both horrible, but geez, one of them is worse aren't they? I am a proud patriot and a huge critic of my nation-state. The US has made many mistakes and has many short comings, but at least we're a democratic republic where people don't have to live in fear that the secret police will come take them away for an offhanded comment they made in the elevator to themselves.

They're also pulling off mass expansion with the Belt and Road initiative and the massive amounts of funding and assistance given to African nations to help modernize their infrastructure. Putting these developing nations in debt to China and leaving their infrastructure dependant (at least in part) on Chinese companies is a large area of developing influence.

They can't just object to a new law, and no they can't force any change as the only consequence can be damages.  What is an example where NAFTA's ISDS provision was abused to force a change in law where there was not underlying discrimination against foreign investor in favor of a domestic one?

Yes it had implications for IP regulation, but not detrimental from US perspective.

How would it have damaged environmental protections?

Trade deals aren't about jobs, they are about efficiencies.  Yes there are short term shifts that people misconstrue as job losses.  Yes, the second order benefit of job increases from those efficiency gains are overstated by some.  but the overwhelming consensus of subject matter experts is that trade arrangements like nafta are a net positive to ordinary americans and that there was not  negative job impact in long-run.

Damn all those native American reservations aren't attempts at making ""amends"". That cools. Also I guess when America gave Liberia to former slaves that wasn't trying to make amends for their transgressions.

&gt;So what's your point? That Germany today is Nazi Germany pre 1945

Yes, if Germany wants to stand by China's genocide of the uyghur people. Then Germany today is like Germany in 1945. Once Angela Merkel condemns China for their genocide of the uyghur people and puts sanctions on China till they change. Germany condones China actions of genocide. Hell Merkel is willing to work with China to ""stick it"" to Trump. 

https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/07/germany-china-trade-coronavirus-us-351922 

&gt;While China has come under criticism across much of the Western world, in particular in the U.S. and U.K., for not being more transparent about the origins of the coronavirus outbreak and, more recently, for its suspension of democratic norms in Hong Kong, the German government has been more cautious in its response."

2020-07-13 17:16:07,BannedAgain6969,"Well then, maybe they shouldn't have made the TPP a giveaway to corporate interests. Here is some of the garbage the TPP would have done:

* ""investor trade dispute settlement"" - giving corporations the power to sue governments to force laws to be repealed [https://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/National%20Office/2016/06/Foreign\_Investor\_Protections\_TPP.pdf](https://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/National%20Office/2016/06/Foreign_Investor_Protections_TPP.pdf)
* extending copyright terms in all signatories
* damaging environmental protection

The TPP was negotiated in secret by corporate interests - until GreenPeace leaked a copy this is how elected government officials were required to view the draft document. [https://boingboing.net/2016/05/05/mep-tours-the-farcical-viewing.html](https://boingboing.net/2016/05/05/mep-tours-the-farcical-viewing.html)

I hear a lot of bitching about how ""TPP was our chance to have a seat at the table to counterbalance China"" but it was really more like corporate pigs around a trough. Sure would have been great to contain China but the opportunity was blown in the negotiation not when TPP was killed.

By the way the US government itself predicted no job gains from TPP. Based on previous trade deals (e.g. how NAFTA predicted job gains) we can pretty safely assume this would have caused further industrial job losses in the US.

I don't know whether you actually know anything about TPP and you're lying about what it would have actually done, or whether you're ignorant and you're just parroting the propaganda that was brought out when it was killed. Either way, not a good look."

They are all suffering because of having seperate religious or ethnic identity. Its just inevitable that they will suffer. They will either be forced to assimilate or keep suffering until they get independence when the country they are part of is weak and ready to collapse.  


The balkans and Greece suffered 300 years under Turkish empire. Some assimilated and became turks. Some maintained their identity through countless suffering and finally was able to gain independence when the opportunity came.

When looking at all the problems in the US or france between whites and blacks, in India between Hindus and Muslims, the difficulties even very open countries like the scandinavian one have with integration of immigrants, i can see how some countries like Japan, South Korea or Russia choose to take the other option. This of course has its own set of challenges and problems, but it’s different kind of problems. That does not mean that diversity has not many advantages, it has. But for many people the only benefit of a more heterogeneous society they can see is a more diverse cuisine, while the problems are easier to spot and point out.

I believe „using immigration to solve its birthrate“ is probably something only Germany will be able to successfully pull off, because they can use its economic strength to bleed the rest of the EU dry of talented young people looking for opportunities.

I actually wonder when the first of those aging countries will take the drastic step of binding pensions to the number of children the retiree has. Basically all countries with a good successful working pensionsystem have unsustainable birthrates, while countries where children are your retirementplan (mostly because the country is poor and/or the government and/or it spensionsystem is total trash) are above replacement rates. The other „solution“ would be to rollback emancipation, feminism and female education, but that is some horrific handmaidstale bullshit that hopefully no country will ever try (looking at you china)."

The fact is that nobody respects the US right now, but it still has strong allies. Weak economies like India or Canada still have strong international backing because they have legitimate allies, and not just economic benefactors.

And China has been shooting itself in the foot for the last decade. Prior to Xi, your approval in Japan, Korea, and ASEAN was rising to a degree you hadn't had since before the Qing Empire. Even in India, feelings about China were mostly split between positive and unsure. What the CCP under Xi has been showing nearby nations is that a strong China will be their enemy or their owner, and ensuring that they fear a strong China and look to weaken it.

&gt; The Australian government says it will offer around 10,000 Hong Kong passport holders currently living in Australia a chance to apply for permanent residence once their current visas expire.

&gt; It&amp;#039;s certainly an easier pathway to permanent residency and of course, once you&amp;#039;re a permanent resident, there&amp;#039;s then a pathway to citizenship there, he said.

Which is for few years fully in PiS hands and is a propaganda tube. Their latest materials are on Russian/North Korea levels of propaganda, feel free to look for them. During the debate that happened in this TV there were reports that he knew actions beforehand. And his main rival (which has lost in 2nd round) was receiving questions which were crafted to reduce his time to answer (as the timer started when question was being asked, not after).
Also pushing reforms at night in a surprise meetings, so the opposition could not attend it are very far from democracy.

&gt; TAIPEI - Germany suddenly and unceremoniously replaced Taiwan&amp;#039;s flag with a blank, white banner under its listing for the country on the foreign ministry website -prompting one reporter to ask if it was a white flag of surrender to China.

&gt; At the 1:01:12 mark of an hour-long press conference on Friday, a German reporter asked, &amp;quot;Why did Taiwan&amp;#039;s flag disappear and become a blank column in the introduction of national conditions of various countries on the official website of the German foreign ministry? Is this a white flag raised to the Chinese? What&amp;#039;s going on? Except for Taiwan, other countries have flags. What is going on with the German foreign ministry?&amp;quot;.

&gt; Twitter user &amp;quot;Chiang Kai Shek&amp;quot; pointed out the flag of Palestine does indeed appear, while for Taiwan the website displays the white flag, the international symbol for surrender.

On the other hand, I don’t consider myself much of any other nationality/citizenship either. I’m legally bound to a country and a culture I didn’t grow up in, where I am considered just as foreign as someone from the opposite side of the world, and my native language abilities are, at best, subpar.

It is no wonder the number 1 guy will find it annoying and irritating. He might even find reasons and excuses that the other guy is a phony and not actually that good. In fact, he might be cheating. No, he is certainly cheating and all he needs is a good slap to show its true place.   


An upstart like China getting hated by the west is only natural since its starting to look like a challenger. The question is, is the rest of world that has been suffering under western hegemony looking at China with relief that a new challenger has arrived to balance things out. Are they looking at China with more respect and starting to question the superiority of the west?  


I think they are. China's reputation as a viable challenger in the rest of the world is climbing fast. So the ball is in the court of the west. Its time to really pay up to keep your hegemony. You cannot assume other countries will follow you without you throwing money at it. So, are you willing to pay for your number 1 position?"

Having the clitoris cut off and having the foreskin removed are not on the same level.

2020-07-13 01:29:39,gnarlin,Would it also be cultural imperialism to ban removing both eyes (if that was done for religious reasons)? What about removing all fingers from one hand? What about 4 finger? At what point does the unethicalness of this become to obvious and too blatant exactly? Maybe chopping a top of the little finger for religious reasons be ok? No? This is a fallacious argument. Chopping up the genitals of little children is wrong regardless of the country it is done in. The ethics of it are universal because reducing the potential spectrum of life experiences from children who have no faculties of choosing are all but impossible to reverse or diminish in any way in the future.

2020-07-12 23:03:19,ttystikk,"This is very helpful, thank you. India should be its own manufacturing powerhouse instead of relying on China for it. 

Instead of limiting foreign development money, India should welcome it.

There are so many other legal obstacles that many companies have thrown up their hands and simply gone elsewhere, like Indonesia, Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand, etc.

In fact, India is not competitive and has not been for a long time. Modi is not doing much to clear this problem but is instead busying himself and the country with creating more divisions, the better to find scapegoats to blame. 

As OBOR continues to be built out throughout Asia, around India if they won't participate, the economic development that infrastructure brings will bypass India and frankly that's an outcome they cannot afford.

India's smartest move right now would be to find a permanent solution to the Kashmir and other border regions, using the promise of a market of 1.4 billion people as incentive for the Chinese and the Pakistanis to resolve their differences with India. Doing so would immediately clear a path for India to leap ahead like China has done over the last 40 years. 

The country most threatened by such an alliance is the United States but they are showing every sign of declining as a world power and it would be short-sighted of India to depend on Washington for economic it military protection going forward."

And what would be the consequences of drinking alcohol as a Muslim anyway? Can you claim that you converted if you get caught?

This seems like the kind of law that is either not really enforceable (i.e. anyone can technically legally drink alcohol as long as they are willing to claim they are not Muslim), or comes with huge infringements on privacy and religious freedom.

2020-07-12 18:40:45,Redditor154448,"Good luck finding a similar number in China.  They're dead and the people that loved them are cowed into silence.  That was done by the CCP when it was mostly weak.  They're getting stronger and they show no inclination to stop doing evil things.

You are talking anecdotal evidence.  I'm talking statistics, averages.

The US ran and is still running an empire.  They have had and still have by far the most potent military force on Earth.  It is the most frighteningly powerful nation the world has ever seen.  Yet, time and again -- but certainly not always, they have chosen to not lay waste to their enemies.  For every death you can lay at the feet of the American empire, I can lay 10 that they could have killed, that most empires would have killed, but chose not to.  I hold no illusions that an empire run by the CCP would be so benign.

Great powers wage war; that's what they do.  They all did in their respective empires throughout history.  The British empire was, on a shit per capability index, worse than the Americans.  The Spanish were worse than the British and the Ottomans worse still.  The Romans would have been off the scale, but then people back then had different ideas about terror and control.  They were more like the CCP.

In any study of history, the American empire is unusual not in the wars its fought, the  deaths caused, but by the restraint shown, the help given.  The CCP, in comparison, is evil and has always been as evil as it had the power to be.

I stand by my statement.  Forced to make a choice between living under the US (even under Trump) or the CCP... no contest.  Not even close."

&gt; In June, Japan and the US commemorated the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Okinawa, which was one of the final battles of the war, and ended six weeks before the US dropped nuclear bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

The periodic heating occurs due to the tilting of the Earth's axis which causes more sunlight to reach us thus heating the Earth. Liquids can hold lower amounts of CO2 when warmer which causes oceans and other bodies of water to release CO2 and sustain the rising temperature. CO2 levels have never been nearly as high and we're at the time where the Earth should be cooling down not heating up."

Do you have a citation for that?  In reality what he said was that if he could have exonerated Trump he would have.  But he didn't.  He also said that investigating collusion was not in his mandate, so he would specifically not be looking at that.  All of this is in the report, so at least one of us read it.

While you're looking for that citation, maybe check out what obstruction is.  One thing that you'll find is missing is the requirement that charges be filed for the underlying crime."

It's all relative to what we're used to. It's not like Americans think they need attention when we talk loud, it's just that we're used to loudness either as a sign of happiness ""Hey buddy! I haven't seen you in ages!!!"" Or anger ""Hey, buddy! Stop what you're doing!""

We're not doing it because we want to be the loudest voice in the room, we do it because we're showing our emotions with our volume.

It's just like how German people speak so directly. People think they're cold assholes for it, but they're genuinely just either letting you know, or they're genuinely interested but the way their language works just makes it sound abrasive. Some guy in Germany came up to me and plainly asked ""Why are you wearing that coat?"" When I was wearing an East German Army jacket, and I thought that he was mad or something because of how he sounded. After I told him that I enjoy collecting old military jackets and that I liked the aesthetic, he thought that was pretty cool and he was just actually curious.

I'm rambling now because I'm stoned, but the point I'm trying to make is that of course people who grow up speaking a foreign language are all going to have their strange quirks that other people aren't used to."

2020-07-12 09:34:04,Langernama,"#No EU budget if rule of law discussed, Orbán says
‘Let’s put this debate aside now,’ said the Hungarian prime minister.

There will be no new EU budget if the negotiations are mixed up with rule of law debates, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said Friday.

Speaking on state-owned Kossuth Rádió, the Hungarian leader said that if arguments over the rule of law are included in the bloc's funding decisions ""there will not be an economic restart, there will not be a budget, there will be drawn-out debates.""

When EU leaders gather in Brussels for a budget summit starting July 17, they are expected to also discuss a proposal to link EU funding to respect for certain rule of law criteria. Debate is currently centering on the details of how a new rule of law mechanism would be triggered.

""Let's put this debate aside now,"" Orbán said in his radio interview. ""Let's resolve the economic problems, restart our economies, start creating jobs, then we can continue the rule of law debates.""

Hungary, along with Poland, is currently facing so-called Article 7 proceedings over rule of law concerns.

Orbán's comments drew criticism in the European Parliament.

""It is a disgrace for Viktor Orbán to threaten the recovery of a whole continent from COVID-19, just so he can continue to dismantle democracy in Hungary,"" said Dacian Cioloș, a former Romanian prime minister and now president of the Renew Europe group. ""We need a strong recovery fund to invest in our common European destiny, but our future must also be built on basic common democratic values,"" he said."

If Hassan Nasrallah, the chief of Hezbollah, has his way, that may soon change. Nasrallah recently declared in a televised speech that Lebanon must “look east” to China for its salvation at its present time of crisis. The implication was clear: Lebanon should not look to the International Monetary Fund. His Lebanese audience was left befuddled. The extent of crisis was evident—the country’s economy has nosedived, to calamitous effect, in recent weeks—but Lebanon, including some of its most reactionary conservatives, has always understood itself as an outpost of Western values and influence in the Middle East.

But Nasrallah is not alone among Lebanese policymakers in believing the country may soon have no choice but to enter China’s political and economic orbit. If that happens, political analysts say, it could mark a new and uncertain chapter in the country’s history.

Lebanon’s economy is in shambles, threatening to join Zimbabwe or Venezuela as one of the world’s terminal economic disasters. Since October 2019, the Lebanese pound has lost 80 percent of its value and plummeted from its fixed exchange rate of 1,500 to the U.S. dollar to 8,000 last week on the black market. Salaries earned in the local currency have turned worthless as prices of basic commodities have tripled. Rises in food prices (including for bread) have hit the middle and lower classes especially hard, and electricity cuts have become regular occurrences. Some Lebanese have started resorting to barter, while the young and unemployed are increasingly opting for desperate measures to make a living. A 24-year-old graduate recently walked from shop to shop in a downtown Beirut market popular with expatriates to sell freshly squeezed orange juice. “Hi, will you support me, please,” he asked everyone plaintively.

But Lebanon’s ruling elite continue to drag their feet on political and economic reforms meant to halt corruption and restructure indebted banks, measures necessary to procure a $10 billion bailout from the IMF. Two European diplomats told Foreign Policy that division between Lebanese political factions is the reason the IMF loan hasn’t yet come through. Last week, Alain Bifani, one of Lebanon’s top negotiators with the IMF, resigned from his senior position at the finance ministry and was quoted as saying he had reached a “dead end” with the political and financial elite. He said those with vested interests were obstructing the path to change, because any bailout envisioned a haircut of $3 billion on accounts held by the country’s most wealthy. Millions of Lebanese have been braving a de facto haircut since banks imposed capital controls in mid-November 2019 and refused to let them withdraw their money. A few days after Bifani’s resignation, talks with the IMF were suspended entirely.

Among the few countries able to productively mediate between the IMF and Lebanon would be the United States, a traditional ally of Beirut and the fund’s largest contributor. But, even as Lebanon’s economic crisis accelerates, the United States and Lebanon’s political actors have intensified their war of words. Hezbollah has blamed the United States for deliberately stopping the flow of dollars to Lebanon, while the American representatives accused Hezbollah of hoarding dollars and large-scale smuggling. Last week, a Lebanese judge reprimanded U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Dorothy Shea after she criticized Hezbollah. He said she was “pitting the Lebanese people against each other,” and, in an unprecedented move, he banned media organizations from interviewing her for a year. He added that any violation would be punished with a $200,000 fine. (In a show of defiance, several local TV channels had the ambassador on air the same evening.) The United States, by unilaterally imposing Caesar Act sanctions on the Syrian regime, has also prevented the Lebanese economy from benefiting from any reconstruction of its neighboring country.

Meanwhile, China, although it has little historic political presence in the region, is waiting in the wings, prepared to replace the United States as the country’s dominant outside actor. Chinese companies have been trying to launch big projects in Lebanon for almost a decade and have been especially eager to invest in Lebanon’s infrastructure. Forty percent of Lebanese imports are already Chinese, and in the last few years Beijing has enhanced cultural ties by building a new Beirut music center. It sent military aid during Lebanon’s 2006 war against Israel and deployed peacekeepers afterward. During the coronavirus pandemic, it exercised soft diplomacy and supplied medical assistance, including testing kits. At the height of Lebanon’s coronavirus outbreak, the country’s top doctors arranged for online conference calls with their Chinese counterparts for information on how best to deal with the health crisis.

Few originally thought China’s overtures would alter the basic calculations of Lebanon’s policymakers, given the Lebanese banking system’s dependence on the U.S. dollar and remittances from Lebanese expatriates in the West. But Lebanon is now desperate enough to explore whatever help Beijing can give. Soon after Hezbollah suggested turning to investments from China, instead of a bailout from the IMF, as the panacea to Lebanon’s economic crisis, Lebanon’s prime minister met with the Chinese ambassador to seek China’s help and expand economic cooperation.

China’s interest in the Middle East is anchored in the Belt and Road Initiative that aims to expand Chinese influence around the world through economic ties. China wants to resurrect long-decayed road and rail links between Beirut and Tripoli on Lebanon’s Mediterranean coast to the Syrian cities of Damascus and Homs, and beyond, as part of a broader infrastructure network it controls across Eurasia. Reducing U.S. influence in Lebanon would be a bonus.

Some Lebanese are intrigued by the prospects of partnering with a dynamic China. But many political observers, including some in government, are more circumspect, wary of potential exploitation. A member of parliament, speaking to Foreign Policy on condition of anonymity, said he was doubtful if “Americanized” Lebanese would embrace China if that required loosening ties with the United States. “We need to assess the readiness of the Lebanese first,” he said, “and if the Chinese conditions are going to be acceptable.” Camille Abu Suleiman, Lebanon’s former labor minister, said that even though he welcomed Chinese investments in principle, the reports of their track record had reached Lebanon. Beijing is infamous for laying so-called debt traps—offering quick loans to build infrastructure in underdeveloped countries but at an unusually high-interest rate. When the country is unable to pay the debt, China simply seizes the assets. “I don’t ever see Lebanon getting back on its feet without an IMF program,” Suleiman said.

Sami Nader, a Lebanese political analyst, shared a similar view. “Chinese investments will yield results in five to six years. By then Lebanon will be dead,” he said. “We need liquidity now, we need an IMF loan. And how does China expect us to pay it back?” Shen Dingli, a leading Chinese foreign-policy expert, said Beijing did not need every country it helped to pay the loan back and can afford to be a soft power to expand its clout globally. “When we were poor, the U.S. helped us. We remember that. Now we are in a position to help others,” he said implying China was readying to be the next United States. “We can gift a few hundred million dollars to countries who, for instance, promise to support us on Taiwan internationally.”

For those protesting on Lebanon’s streets, the priority isn’t just immediate survival but institutional reforms against corruption that ensure the country does not quickly end up in the same situation again. For them, that’s why help from China—which has long been known to turn a blind eye to malfeasance by the foreign politicians it loans money to—seems the least attractive option on offer. But the Lebanese are also acutely aware that they are running out of time."

There's only two possible ways to resolution, one is letting the disease progress and the other is a vaccine. And vaccines normally take DECADES to develop. We STILL don't have a herpes vaccine after many, many attempts. If it's even possible to have a CV vaccine (early signs are promising) it's not a this-year thing. Maybe a next-year thing if we're very very lucky, due to the massive worldwide effort being put into this.

(Yes New Zealand eradicated it. Good for them. They put a lockdown in place less than a month after the first case arrived and it STILL took several months for all the cases to die out. They are pretty much at the outer edge of how CV can be eradicated with pseudo-quarantines.) 

Vaccines are very tricky things. Look at the dengue fever vaccine -- if it's given to someone who's never had dengue fever it makes the first infection WORSE. That's why these things have to be tested very carefully. This isn't Star Trek where Dr. McCoy whips up a vaccine before the third commercial break."

EU external and development spending is in line to be the biggest loser from next week’s crunch EU budget summit in Brussels. The blueprint outlined on Friday (10 July) by European Council President Charles Michel includes a reduction of €4.7 billion for the Neighbourhood Development and International Cooperation Instrument in the EU's next seven-year budget.. EPA-EFE/KENZO TRIBOUILLARD / POOL

EU external and development spending is in line to be the biggest loser from next week’s crunch EU budget summit in Brussels. The blueprint outlined on Friday (10 July) by European Council President Charles Michel includes a reduction of €4.7 billion for the Neighbourhood Development and International Cooperation Instrument in the EU’s next seven-year budget.

The new ‘Neighbourhood and the World’ budget heading, bringing together all of the EU’s external action spending, would be allocated €98.4 billion between 2021 and 2027 and include €26 billion to be allocated to programmes in sub-Saharan Africa.

EU leaders will meet for a special European Council on 17-18 July next week but with governments focused on their own economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, there are unlikely to be many voices speaking up to protect the bloc’s spending outside its borders.

Next week, finance ministers in the G20 will meet to discuss whether to extend a suspension on debt repayments for the world’s poorest countries into 2021, many of whom are likely to be worst hit by the pandemic.

In April, the G20 agree to suspend debt payments for 73 of the world’s poorest countries for the remainder of 2020, at a value of around $12 billion. 41 of the 73 countries are accepting the relief.

However, development aid is likely to suffer cuts at the national level in the coming years. EU countries are facing an average GDP fall of 8% in 2020, which will, in turn, inevitably lead to lower budgets.

But civil society and development campaigners had hoped that the EU budget would be protected.

“President Michel’s proposal is incoherent with the Council’s stated priorities,” said Emily Wigens, EU Director at The ONE Campaign.

“Barely one week after adopting conclusions on Africa underlining that a prosperous, peaceful and resilient Africa is essential for Europe, he suggests cutting funds to sub-Saharan Africa where up to 50 million people risk being pushed into extreme poverty this year,” Wigens added.

The planned cuts will not, however, come as a total surprise. External and development spending by both the EU and its member states was cut in the last seven-year budget, which was negotiated in the aftermath of the 2007-8 crash and the subsequent double-dip recession.

Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, insiders had expected the external spending budget to be between €100 billion and €120 billion, representing around 6% of the total EU budget.

In April, members of the Development Assistance Committee of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development vowed that they would “strive to protect aid budgets”.

Civil society campaigners expect that since most EU countries and other DAC members are set to see their economies decline by between 5% and 10% in 2020, that will, in turn, significantly reduce aid budgets."

2020-07-11 21:49:48,TENTAtheSane,"See, the thing is, all the nations involved in that region, India, pakistan, China, Nepal, bhutan all care about only one thing. 

Water.

They all peddle the ""ancient glory"" and ""rightful land"" bullshit to their citizens to get their consent, but that's not the real story.

As population in the world is rapidly increasing and resources like water are being increasingly used up, water in the near future is going to be with more than its volume in gold.

The Indus, the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, the Mekong, the Pearl and the Yangtze river systems, which together form the water supply for almost a third of the world's population, all have their sources in the Tibetan plateau/ Himalayas region.

If someone were to gain control of this supply, they could become unimaginably powerful.  This is the game they are playing now.

China knows such a thing is within their grasp, they've been slowly working towards it since the formation of communist China, and now at the last stretch they're rushing for it.

India knows this, but also know they can't do anything about it alone, so their strategy has been to play it safe, keep a tight hold on what they do have, and try to delay China's push until they can build a global anti-china coalition to push them out of the game. The present widespread anti-China sentiment in the world presents an opportune situation for this, and they're pressing to capitalise on it.

For Pakistan, they realise this too, and they briefly tried to go against China too, but soon gave up and have resigned themselves to the fact that China's got them by the balls. However, their rivers that originate in China pass through Indian Kashmir before reaching them, and giving India the ability to cut off most of their water supply at will is diverting they absolutely can't allow, so they've been desperately trying to push India out of the region.

Nepal wants to be a major player too, but sandwiched between India and China, they've had little opportunity to do that, and have instead often before a battlefield for proxy wars between India and China bent upon puppeting them.

Bhutan's just vibing."

I think the ""information age"" had made this a much more widespread and common phenomenon. It's so easy to live in and maintain individual fairyland social bubbles/worldviews; it's extremely easy to find information that confirms whatever you believe no matter how far out it is. It's also very easy to spread misinformation. Social media posts will get thousands of likes or upvotes before anyone even notices something's wrong with it, and even when someone does notice no one else hears their warning because they aren't reading the comments or whatever and the post isn't affected because the poster just wants views or whatever no matter what or because they themselves still aren't ready to believe what they're saying isn't true. That's why flat earthers and anti-vaxxers have become more and more popular I think.

**Chanting “Impunity is Over!” or dancing against sexual violence, women’s rights activists protested Friday in multiple cities in France and abroad against President Emmanuel Macron’s appointment of a new interior minister who is accused of rape and a justice minister who has minimized the #MeToo movement.**


The actions started Friday morning in Dijon, where new Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin and Prime Minister Jean Castex were meeting with police. A dozen feminists held out banners and signs condemning Darmanin and rape culture.

Later Friday, in front of Paris City Hall, women staged a flash mob and performed the song and dance “ A Rapist in Your Path "" started by feminists in Chile, which has become an international rallying cry against sexual violence and victim shaming.

The young, diverse crowd - most in masks - demanded Darmanin’s resignation and exuded anger at Macron, who had promised to make fighting sexual violence a grand cause of his term. Signs read “Darmanin named, Victims disdained” or “Victims, We See You”.

One of the speakers, who identified herself only as Margaux, said: “Without questioning the fundamental right to the presumption of innocence, the nomination of a man accused of rape reminds us how sexual and sexist violence is normalized and minimized, including at the highest levels of the state.”

“The message sent is very clear: Aggressors, don’t be afraid,” she told the crowd of about 1,000 people.


Feminist group Nous Toutes and others announced other actions Friday in other French cities as well as at French embassies or consulates in London, Sydney, Montreal, Berlin, Brussels, Barcelona and Tel Aviv.

The French government said it remains committed to gender equality and defended the new ministers, stressing the presumption of innocence.

Darmanin firmly denies the rape accusation, and an investigation is underway. New Justice Minister Éric Dupond-Moretti is a lawyer who has defended a government member accused of rape and sexual assault, and has ridiculed women speaking out as a result of the #MeToo movement. 


Activists also expressed concern about LGBTQ rights with Darmanin in charge of French police, because he opposed gay marriage before France legalized it in 2013.

“We have the impression we’re being treated like idiots,” said Paris protester Alix Joly, a 25-year-old graduate student. When she heard about the latest government nominations, she said, “I laughed, but bitterly.”

The protest came amid a growing investigation into accusations by at least 26 women that a Paris street artist well known in the historic Montmartre neighborhood raped or sexually assaulted them. The artist-photographer says he never raped anyone. Lawyers for the accusers say he systematically preyed upon teen girls or young women, plied them with alcohol or drugs and took compromising photos so they would be too ashamed to report what happened.

Officially China was already talking to the WHO on the 31st and the WHO had statements out 4 days later (over the holiday) [Timeline here](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/27-04-2020-who-timeline---covid-19)

3) Her only source to say her life is in danger is a US-based blogger and HK activist?

2020-07-11 14:17:20,WanderingRekaterac,"This time, not directly to do with Greece or Cyprus. It's cheap pandering to distract the public from the crumbling economy, new social media restrictions, and the new horrifying bar law. Also because they could. The most common pro-government argument was that ""we don't care about what Europeans think; we have a right by sword to make Hagia Sophia whatever we want."""

2020-07-11 14:08:58,PikaPant,"It's because the West is also slowly getting dominated by politically correct (ie ignorant of radical Islamofascism) leftists, whether it's Merkel who leads the EU, or American politicians like Bernie, Biden and Ilhan Omar. If these people aren't kept in place then there is going to be further damage to humanity like we're seeing in Turkey.  
  
We live in truly troubling times."
2020-07-11 14:07:56,ttystikk,"Soooooo many variables. I would take a wild guess at 30% chance of war. Neither side wants a war but won't back down. The land itself isn't as valuable as the resources it provides elsewhere, such as water.

It's silly and short-sighted; all nations in the area have so much more to gain by cooperating."
2020-07-11 14:06:23,WanderingRekaterac,"I hope its fate will not end up like the other Hagia Sophias in Bursa and Trabzon. I visited the one in Bursa a few years ago. I think ""pathetic"" is the only word I can describe that ""restoration."""
2020-07-11 14:02:50,WanderingRekaterac,"You're right. Erdoğan came into power as a ""liberal democrat Muslim."" The West loved him for a decade while he destroyed the country's status quo from within. He worked with cults and stole power from the secularists, while the West continued to praise and enable him. When he showed his true colors it was already too late."
2020-07-11 13:48:58,WanderingRekaterac,It was not just the economy this time. [The government used Hagia Sophia as a distraction from the new bar law.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-lawyers-idUSKCN24C08L) And our gullible nationalists ate it.
2020-07-11 13:42:41,Morcalvin,I’m sure as hell not. I have family living in India.
2020-07-11 13:41:13,280ps,Why do some people sound like they're looking forward for this to escalate?
2020-07-11 13:40:32,WanderingRekaterac,"I heard about this last night and cried for hours. At least I got to see it as a museum last year. If you still want to visit it for some reason, do it before the 24th, when the first prayer is scheduled. Islamists are already chanting near its entrance. Makes me really depressed.

And people defending this with bullshit arguments like ""sovereignty"" and ""it's our sword right; we conquered it"" are just ridiculous. They talk about world heritage like it's the Medieval era. The ruling party did it because they could. It's pandering to the neo-Ottomanists and Islamic nationalists for easy votes. But the sad part will be the lost tourism revenue, which the gov will try to compensate with more taxes. We're already being taxed to the brim. I wonder how they will find more creative ideas to pay for Hamza Salih's birthday party.

The worst part is not even that. The government has been trying to pass a law that will end the independence of lawyers. There will be different bars, representing different ideologies and getting different treatment because of it. This likely means that as a lawyer if you're not affiliated with the Islamist bar the gov will screw you over. Erdoğan used this to distract the public from this monstrosity. He succeeded.

Happy nightmares."

2020-07-11 11:54:11,outoftunediapason,"The administration of Hagia Sophia was transferred to the presidency of religious affairs. I'm pretty sure they won't be so keen on preserving Hagia Sophia as it is, so it wouldn't surprise me if they ruin parts of the building for the sake of restoration. I think this is the most significant outcome."
2020-07-11 11:51:25,Senior_Indoorsman,"I lived in inner mongolia (the part of mongolia choose to stay in China) and know a little about this. If our goverment claim mongolia, I guess they will deny the referendum of mongols independence in last century. The whole mongolia belongs to China in the ROC period and independent because the oppresson of a Chinese warlord and the support of Russia."
2020-07-11 11:27:45,Ongo_Gablogian___,"You clearly have no idea what a straw man is...

It's Trumps election to lose since he's currently in office and is going to be pursuing every under handed tactic he can to win. So by not voting for either you help out the candidate you dislike the most, because you can't complain when either candidate wins over the other since you didn't do your part.

Secondly, it isn't support for a 2 party system, it is a terrible system, but you can't pretend that it isn't the system you're currently in. You don't fix the system by voting as if you aren't in a 2 party system, that is INCREDIBLY moronic. That doesn't fix anything. 

If you really trusted Bernie then why don't you trust him now when he implores his voters to vote for Biden?"

2020-07-11 10:38:17,onespiker,The main thing about it is that its a distraction from the economic crisis and a political pandering. In reality it barely matters and changes next to nothing.
2020-07-11 10:36:18,another_one_bites459,"Really Amazing, I stopped after I realized how good it's made so I can read it in the right frame of mind"
2020-07-11 10:28:11,VagabondDuck,"The only thing I can think of besides Christians being sad is the country pushing itself to be less and less secular, which is upsetting because Ataturk had some pretty cool and clear ideas for Turkey and as stated in the article he's the one that turned it into a museum. 

Half the country wants to remain secular as well but the other half not so much but it looks like erdogan is doubling down on appealing to the islamists and this is another win for them bolstering that kind of support. Its political pandering and maybe a source of personal pride for Erdogan. But thats just my take.

For you and I tho? Nothing much, you will still be able to visit it if you want just might have to take your shoes off!"

2020-07-11 06:27:28,Baconreaderlurker,"I think the education sector brings in so much money for the country that it's hard to cut it off. The same can be said for Australia.

While both countries have stated some sort of stance against China they can't ignore one of their lathers revenue streams. 

While China itself also understands the importance of sending their offspring to western education institutions even if it's for name recognition they will never stop because globally no one cares if you graduated top of your class in a Chinese University."
2020-07-11 06:09:03,M1RR0R,"&gt;It's so simple but many seem to want another Trump presidency just because Bernie lost.

Both a strawman argument and blind support for a ""two-party"" system all in one! 

I don't trust Biden. His decades of political history are pretty much the exact opposite of his claimed platform. Don't forget when he previously ran for president he had to drop out because he lied and plagiarized so much."
2020-07-11 05:48:16,Gamer_Koraq,"It's really not outdated at all. I'm very aware of current Libertarian policies and the stances that Jo takes, and they're jaw-droppingly terrible. 

* Defund Planned Parenthood (critical health services for poor communities)
* Allow businesses to deny service for ANY reason (race,gender,etc)
* Allow health insurance to deny coverage for preexisting conditions (no more insurance for asthmatics, diabetic, etc) and further deregulate price restrictions (more drug price hikes and less insurance)
* Eliminate the Department of Education and privatize education (new expense for poor/middle families, wealthy already in private schools)
* Removal of income tax (benefits high earners) and inflation of sales tax (major impact on low/middle income) to compensate. 

Every one of these is a current stance of Jo and the Libertarian Party.

It's an entire platform of ripping away social and consumer protections, and it hands all the benefits of society only to the people who have money. It's not just a handful of problematic ideas among a sea of otherwise good ones, the entire platform is based on the premise of ""government=bad"" which is demonstrably false. Laissez-faire doesn't work.

I mean, unchecked capitalism as a form of government is the basis for almost every dystopian film/book written in the last fifty years."

Perhaps read what I actually wrote before making your conclusions."
2020-07-11 05:44:22,Mrsucky,I don't think our country can afford us not to vote third party. Voting for a major party will not send a message to the Republican or democratic parties. They are quite comfortable going back and forth between power giving us just enough stability so that we feel they are the only options. Now we have two unstable people going head to head which is worse than one unstable racist and one cold hearted bitch.
2020-07-11 05:31:27,Mrsucky,"You are thinking of anarchists. Libertarians for the most part agree that the government is a necessary evil that should not effect your daily life. Jo Jorgensens platform even includes social security, but you would be able to opt out and use that same money to invest instead of being forced to pay social security. They want to stop mandatory schooling for jobs that don't need schooling. (Massage haircuts etc) they want to stop government subsidized college loans to stop students from being overcharged. Essentially they want to eliminate all of the hoops that you jump through on a daily basis simply because it's the way the law is.

2020-07-11 03:38:34,ganges852,"From Singapore here, it’s a start. The ruling party has always had full dominance of parliament, this record high of opposition means little in practice as the government still retains its supermajority.

However, this is still a step in the right direction, for the opposition to slowly build momentum (amid a leadership renewal too) and hopefully one day, be able to provide a proper check and balance and build a large and credible opposition.

Edit: freedom wise, it’s probably not going to change much in the short term, as the government retains its supermajority which they can continue to use to further its agenda."

It's so simple but many seem to want another Trump presidency just because Bernie lost. My top choices were Bernie then Yang, but since that isn't an option we still have to do what we can.

If you want to fix this, it has to start at a local/state level. We need ranked choice voting, and states control how voting works. This is a problem that has to get solved 49 more times (thanks Maine) before we can have something resembling a functional democracy.

2020-07-10 22:11:42,Vikki071,"The funny thing I've found is Muslims will not voice their opinion or protest like they do (for their own faith) for the rights of minorities in Pakistan. Hindus have been and are continuously persecuted, killed, raped in Pakistan even recently, Pakistan's destroyed the foundations of what would be a new Hindu temple ( considering since 1947 they have nearly destroyed est 300.)

Historical documented, in September 1947, Pakistani tribesmen streamed over the border from Pakistan into Indian administered Kashmir. The Kashmiri Hindu King - Maharaja Hari asked for India’s help in fighting off the invasion, but India responded that, in order to gain Indian military assistance, Kashmir would have to accede to India legally, thus becoming part of India, and so that India could protect the King's people and state. The Maharaja agreed and signed the 'Instrument of Accession', the document that LEGALLY aligned Kashmir with the Dominion of India, in October 1947. Hence according to National and International laws Kashmir legally belongs rightfully to India.

If Pakistan didn't persecute religious minorities such as Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians in their country then India's PM Modi wouldn't have to pass the 'Citizenship Amendment Bill' to allow persecuted minorities from Pakistan to come live in India and gain Indian citizenship to live safely. This bill isn't 'Anti-Muslim' as many wrongly believe, but simply to protect persecuted minorities living in Islamic countries such as Pakistan."

2020-07-10 22:06:06,2157345,"Ok it is indeed a rather confusing wall of text. I am a full blown communist/marxist/dialectical materialist whatever, but as you say the label is kinda meaningless because everyone and their mother calls and called themselves communist, from ML's to ba'athists to anarchists. Ill restrain from explaining what exactly I am politically because (no offense) you wont understand.

You should realize that the political compass is just a scale a bit better than the normal left right spectrum. Its funny for memes and to broadly differentiate between some ideologies but its still just a funny little model. To use it as a central tool of ur understanding of politics would be pretty naive. 

I agree that the people on reddit always tend to have more extreme positions (kinda naturally happens as its mostly young people on the internet). But those are just simple positions on an day to day issue inside our system. I like/dislike guns/weed/gay people/the EU isnt an Ideology but rather a single issue people with different ideologies will find different answers to. The ideology is hidden in the argument, it doesnt come from the answer. 

Even if people on r/politics or whatever find similar answers to a single issue as actual far left people (which they overwhelmingly dont), that doesnt make them far left or the ideologies similar. 

Then regarding ur point of libertarians leftists supporting some rather authoritarian solutions to issues. Dont get me wrong, there often is a divergence between label and beliefs but you need to understand that the far left perspective is more often than not outside of the current system. You can be an anarchist and still support taxes or random government project xy as a solution to an issue. ""Librights"" want the most ""freedom"" in the current system, libertarian far leftists want another system entirely. Like yeah in an society conforming to the communist utopia taxes and social programs arent needed but as we factually dont live in one that doesnt mean an anarchist cant support both in a capitalist system. When all the available choices are drastically outside of your ideological goals your preferred solution to an issue is even less influenced by your political stance.

The kitchen knive thing you said about the UK is ehr, ill say ""influenced"" by questionable news sources, id suggest you look into that."

2020-07-10 21:40:40,Apathetic_Zealot,"&gt; You put a lot of effort into that answer so you clearly want to talk about this. 

I don't *want* to talk about it, I'm just annoyed how people hand wave Putin's actions. 

&gt;The Treasury Department had a similar opinion. 

Trump's treasury dept acted in favor of Trump. Shocking.

&gt;That was done right before he called Zelensky about Biden and asked him to investigate him. He unfroze the aid immediately afterwards.

You did just admit what he did, which is an impeachable offense. There should have been no hold or call to coerce. And not all of the aid went out. That's how people ended up asking questions of why is was on hold in the first place.

&gt;Nothing to do with Russia. Trump has otherwise openly supported Ukraine in the conflict .

Laughable. Don't mistake the will of Congress and Trump's inaction. Trump isn't all powerful or perfect - he does what he can. It has nothing to do with Russia? Too many coincidences eventually lead to a trend.

&gt;The rest are things like him refusing to say his election campaign benefited from foreign interference (why would he)

No, the problem is Trump says the Russians were helping the Democrats when the opposite is true. It's all a ""democrat hoax"". Let alone the possibility that their influence tipped the election (which combined with other factors did).

&gt;him refusing to call Putin a killer (what world leader would)

Another nonsense zinger! **Trump called Un fat to his face!!** Trump has never been shy about name calling. Tell me, what's Putin's nickname? He doesn't have one.

&gt;him defending the invasion of Afghanistan (well, America did the same thing to Afghanistan).

Trump engaging in whataboutism in defense of Putin is something a Russian asset would do.

&gt;""lol, so what""

Trump acting like a clown would be in Putin's interest. So what? If Trump really was loyal to the US he'd care that US embassies are used in intelligence gathering. So now its harder for US official to operate in Russia. So what?

&gt;Yes, he can. There are no laws that stop him from doing so. But Congress would try.

Even he's not stupid enough to try to take the US out of NATO. The military would probably ignore him if he tried it through EO. He's openly talked about it, and I think he would if he could. But Trump still needs to be re-elected and Congress would have more legal ground to stand on regarding membership.

&gt;and of [Germany] participating in Russia's Nord Stream project, which he sanctioned Germany for.

Yes, that's something Putin would support. Russia wants a divide between the US and Europe. It's a win win, Russia gets closer to Germany and further away from the US diplomatically.

&gt; He wants to redirect some of those troops to other places in Europe, like Poland And last year they made a deal to send 1000 additional US troops to Poland. And he wanted to create a Fort Trump in Poland with thousands of new American troops.

It's pretty obvious Trump supports naming a fort after himself more than moving a paltry number of troops to fill it in order to protect Poland from the enclave of Kaliningrad. It's theater. I doubt Trump even knows where Poland or Kaliningrad are on the map.

&gt;Yeah, remember how they found al-Baghdadi immediately after that and killed him? And then it turned out Trump isn't pulling out everyone after all.

And I remember Trump claimed ISIS was gone. We're still in Syria because that wasn't true.

&gt;The Russians would love that though, so why not make him? Why not, if they have dirt on him?

Because Putin has dirt on Trump, not everyone in the top military brass. The President may be the most important gear in the function of US foreign policy, but he is not the only gear.

&gt;Still, Russia supports Palestine and Israel is one of America's biggest allies. Assad hates them too and they are occupying a part of his country.

From Russia's perspective Syria is important because it is an access way for a mediterranean oil pipeline. Those contested territories are probably not a concern so long as the pipe lines don't go through them.

&gt;People don't like talking to their blackmailers very much though. ... Do you know what people who are being bullied or blackmailed act like? I do. They're very quiet. They don't show admiration for their blackmailers but do their bidding.

I have zero reason to think you know what you're talking about. If you knew anything you'd know Stockholm syndrome causes that exact behavior. And yes, Trump is being held hostage, and everything I've point out shows not only a pattern of loving dictators - but an unusual specific favoritism for Putin.. You prefer to hand wave it as if its nothing. As if Trump is just a child. But you can't explain why it's Russia that always come up. It wasn't Bolsenaro or Duterte that is accused of hacking the election. 

&gt;Name calling is for people who are wrong and have no better arguments

Ha, too bad it's clear I have arguments. Pointing out how your positions rely on not knowing things, ignorance, is not an insult. Every point you've brought up has been shown to be in line with what I've been saying."

2020-07-10 21:34:12,Gulo_gulo_1,"Your reply seems like a bit of an overreaction imo. All he said was ""Hope Biden does better but not having high hopes."" and you reply ""You have some seriously delusional hopes for him."" Not having high hopes is delusional?

But with regards to foreign policy, particularly regarding China, Biden is a massive upgrade on Trump. Trump has nothing but alienate our allies and distract from China's success under Trump, touting how successful he has been when in reality it could not be further from the truth. China has opened up its first international military bases under his guise but without an actual peep from him. With his withdrawl from the TPP, it only allowed China to rewrite the deal with conditions more favorable to itself. Trump not only places tariffs on China, but also on the largest regional counter to China: India. In order to attempt to prevent Chinese further influence in South Asia, it would have made sense to further strengthen ties between the countries, but that is not what Trump did. Even Trump's tariffs on China itself have not really worked out for the better. Many Chinese companies shifted a portion of their production to Vietnam, a country which has historically despised China far more than they ever did the US. But now, Vietnam has Chinese jobs. And now that the tariffs are starting to be drawn back, it ended with China simply agreeing to buy more American goods, which could have been accomplished without all this economic hardship. Navarro even thought the Chinese were too cowardly to offer retaliatory tariffs during the beginning of the trade war. Furthermore, CCP-owned companies continue to buy ports and energy resources around the world, even in the US itself. His ignoring ""shitholes"" in Africa as China builds up powerful alliances with countries quickly growing in power is another grave misstep. Trump is reality-TV star hiding under the guise of businessman who has praised China's being ""tough"" on the Tienanmen Square protesters in the past.

Don't get me wrong, Biden definitely has his issues. He can slur his words and lose his train of thought. But these are problems Donald ""I have the best words"" Trump has too. The man thought committing a crime by drawing with a sharpie on a National Hurricane Center forecast map would fool the world into thinking he was right. Biden might actually try to bring the free world together against the largest dictatorship in the world instead of alienating our allies. In a battle of Dumb and Dumber, I will always choose the former."

2020-07-10 21:01:46,LibertyLizard,"Very true. My default assumption in this partisan era is that most elections will be a toss-up, maybe with a slight edge to the incumbent. I think we're close enough now and Biden's lead is big enough to safely say he's the favorite based on the current environment, but there is a very real chance that things change by November. But to people who are saying Biden is certain to lose... that's just not supported by any evidence whatsoever."

2020-07-10 20:51:55,LibertyLizard,"Remember when the polls showed Trump within the margin of error in battleground states and the media and Clinton supporters misinterpreted that to mean Clinton couldn't possible lose?

That's not the case now. Biden is well ahead in all the battleground states, and even in some ""safe"" red states. It's very possible Trump could win, mainly if he becomes more popular over the next 4 months. But if you don't think Biden is the favorite you're being deliberately obtuse at this point. People act like the polls being slightly off in one election means that they're now completely meaningless. That's nonsense, they are just as accurate as they ever were. There is always some amount of error and that error in 2016 was smaller than average, it just so happened to be a close election that the pundits utterly failed to understand.

Ironically people who are refusing to acknowledge Biden's lead are making the same mistake Clinton supporters did in 2016. The polls showed she was in danger, but because they couldn't imagine someone as detestable as Trump winning, they chose to ignore that information and interpret it to mean Clinton had already secured victory. Now people who are opposed to Biden are doing the same exact thing, except it's even stupider because the polls are showing a very large lead for Biden currently, vs. a slight edge for Clinton in 2016."
