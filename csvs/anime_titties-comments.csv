2020-07-02 12:37:07,Lollifaunt,"From the article:

&gt; For the first time since the Hong Kong protests broke out last year, India on Wednesday spoke out at the United Nations Human Rights Council and said the relevant parties should address the issues “properly, seriously and objectively”. 

[And two months ago:](https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/04/09/india-protests-attacks-over-new-citizenship-law)

&gt; The United Nations and a number of governments have publicly criticized the citizenship law as discriminatory on the basis of religion. But BJP officials have mocked and threatened protesters, while some of their supporters have engaged in mob attacks on critics and anti-government protesters. Some BJP leaders called for the protesters, whom they described as “traitors,” to be shot.

---

I fully agree India should address its issues with human rights violations ""properly, seriously and objectively"":

Both China and India should be spoken out against by the UN, and both their rights to speak out at the human rights counsil should be suspended untill they show some understanding of what ""human rights"" actually encompass. The least we could do is stop giving them a platform to virtue-signal from. This only damages the reputation of the council itself."

The largest single bombing was of the Montreal Stock Exchange on 13 February 1969, which caused extensive damage and injured 27 persons. The FLQ also stole several tons of explosives from military and industrial sites. Financed by bank robberies, they threatened the public through their official communication organ, known as La Cognée.

The Bible is not a flat lawbook that one should read divorced of all context. The Bible is the story of human experience(s) of God. Good and bad. It challenges itself. It struggles with it’s own prophets. It struggles with its own people. And it struggles with God—to be of Israel is, by definition, to wrestle with God. Theology, Jewish and Christian, is to navigate that story within the Bible in a way that speaks truthfully of humans and God. Not to seek a power to beat people with (which applies to Christian bigots and atheists alike)."

And like 150 countries are counted as ""persecuting"" Christians, while 130 or so for Muslims. The ratio of Christians to Muslims in existence and the distribution of those in the world shows, according to this analysis, that a randomly selected Muslim is more likely to be ""persecuted"" than a randomly selected Christian.

Look at the countries listed as ""heavy offenders"" in that analysis. There are plenty of factors in there that put a lot of doubt on that simplistic headline of ""Christians are the most persecuted group"" if you bother to read through the whole thing.

Report shows shocking reality of Christian persecution

The report reveals the details of Christian persecution and the lack of response by the UK and other European countries. It states that “the overwhelming majority (estimated at 80 per cent) of persecuted religious believers are Christian.” Following these observations, it illustrates the degree of persecution perpetrated by both non-state and state actors drawing on examples from Iraq, Nigeria, Syria, Pakistan, China, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia. Extremes like violence, threats, enslavement, rape, executions, blasphemy laws, anti-conversion laws, church demolitions, forced disappearances, and even genocide are described in detail. The report calls for better religious literacy in the Foreign Service and the prioritization of countering Christian persecution in UK foreign policy.

You can do that probably for many other groups and subject , using the streisand effect for guerilla marketing. And to supress negative review of your stuff, pretend in interview that people will bomb review your work out of spite/bigotery. 

I also suspect that quite a few film maker in holywood have already been using the idea. e.g. when ghostbuster (the most recent) came out with the pretense bigot/mysoginist were making threat or petition against it or whatnot, I searched for thread about that in the usual places , e.g. 4chan, reddit, something awful, twitter, etc.... And found remarkably very few such reaction as touted by the director which kept bringing that subject up - basically your usual background of idiot, not much more.

I understand your doubts. Mostly I identify as a catholic because I strongly believe that the Church, led by the figure of the Pope, is a fundamentally good idea to keep the believers adherent to the teachings of Christ (mind you: I didn’t say I like what the Church is now or what it has done in the past, but I strongly believe in the need of a “main base” for Christian teachings to develop). But I can understand that under certain views my religiosity can be seen as a “new” way of Christianity; but be careful. I still go to church and follow the catholic rites. Catholicism isn’t only about being strick and intolerant, it has a very complex structure that has to be followed, and by doing so I can hardly see myself as anything but a catholic.

2020-07-02 11:02:07,Langernama,"#UK claims €141 million Unilever tax money paid to Netherlands
The British tax authorities submitted a 141 million euros claim to Unilever for tax that the company wrongly paid in the Netherlands, according to the British authorities. The claim involves taxes paid in 2015, but could stretch over several years and reach 600 million euros, the company wrote in a previously unnoticed passage in its annual report, NOS reports.

Unilever opposed the claim and started a procedure in which the British and Dutch governments have to talk to each other to prevent the company paying tax on the same profits in both countries. Should the British win this battle, Unilever expects to have to reclaim at least 174 million euros from the Dutch tax authorities, the company said to NOS. The amount is higher, because the profit tax rate is higher in the Netherlands than in the United Kingdom. 

The British tax claim revolves around whether a significant part of the Dutch branch of Unilever moved to the United Kingdom years ago. Unilever has always consisted of a Dutch part with food products and a British part with cleaning products and deodorant. Last month, Unilever decided to give up the two-country structure and [become a completely British company](https://nltimes.nl/2020/06/11/unilever-become-officially-british-rotterdam-office-wont-close) with headquarters only in London. This decision was the apotheosis of a long discussion, in which Unilever [first chose Rotterdam in 2018] (https://nltimes.nl/2018/02/22/unilever-expected-pick-rotterdam-fleeing-uks-brexit), and then decided to [retract that decision](https://nltimes.nl/2018/10/05/unilver-scraps-move-rotterdam) .

According to the British tax authorities, an important part of the Dutch Unilever had been based in London all this time and therefore should have paid tax in the UK, not the Netherlands. Unilever told NOS that the British authorities believe that the permanent establishment of Unilever NV is in the UK because the NV management moved to the UK ""due to the nature of the Unilever Group's composite board"". Tax  law professor Jan van de Streek explained it as such: ""If a director of the Dutch business unit lives and works in London, and makes important decisions about the part there, the British tax authorities can regard this as a British branch of the company and Unilever has to settle with the UK tax authorities."" 

Neither Unilever nor the British tax authorities would tell NOS which part of the Dutch branch they believe moved to the UK in 2015. The Dutch Ministry of Finance also wouldn't comment on the matter, according to the broadcaster.

According to NOS, it is striking that the British authorities filed this claim for 2015 taxes only last year, when Unilever was dithering over the decision of whether to base the company in the UK or the Netherlands. Unilever said this tax claim played no part in its decision for London headquarters. But according to Van de Sneek, it is customary to have consultations with the tax authorities in the involved countries prior to such big decisions. Usually countries would try to lure a country there with pretty promises. ""It is speculation, but the idea is tempting that the British have chosen an aggressive approach,"" Van de Sneek said to NOS. ""Like: if you come to London you won't have these kinds of problems anymore."""

And while christianity as a loose term applies to many races and cultures, as far as I've seen this film is targeting american christianity as its sources. You cant claim that the racial analogy doesent work because of the world wide nature of christianity as a middle eastern belief system when america and the west whitewashed jesus as soon as they got thier hands on the religeon. Christianity isent one entity, its lots if little entities that share the same name and source book, then apply it in vastly different ways."

2020-07-02 10:54:01,JuanDunbar,"I'm actually based in England, so when I say that I witness a hell of alot of catholic intolerance it mostly comes from my experience in a more european setting. Catholocism in the way I've seen it has only ever been intolerant, sexist and regressive. I dont understand why when Catholicism has become such a muddled and overarchingly harmful practice to many people (heavily in america but from what I've seen it definitely goes back to Europe as well) why people would still identify as catholic. 

Catholocism is highly old fashioned religeon with strict views on following the bible, being against anything that doesent follow the bible, and putting down resistance to the bible (such as by vilifying and marginalised LGBTQ and non white catholic groups) in almost every aspect of how I have found them.

This is pretty heavily based on personal experience and what I witness via media, I have plenty of friends with religious beliefs but even those from a catholic background have chosen to distinguish themselves from it due to taking a more progressive stance. I just struggle with why people identify as part of a specific sect of belief when thier views differ from that sects roots. 

TLDR: Why wouldent you identify as a new sect of the religeon with more progressive ideals when Catholicism has such a percieved base of regressive and intolerant behaviours around the world?"

Right now I think the issue is that we have been absolutely shitting on people of colour for years, and now white policemen are taxing 70 year old black men with heart conditions in the UK and choking them to death in the streets in america, and that's opened up the lid on somthing that would have been boiling over years ago if we weren't actively holding the lid down all this time.

2020-07-02 08:58:48,DCFY7439,"That article reads like straight up fantasy particularly the Russian part. But, let's grant that fantasy for a moment. Let's say that would be the reality. But, what may or may not happen in 2060 does not play into decisions formed based on current strategic political needs. Who knows what will happen in 40 years. Even in 1934, nobody predicted Europe will go through the bloodiest war in history. Within 40 years, China may very well take over the whole world and make us all speak Chinese. Nobody can predict the future that far. 

My point is on what we can foresee happening in the near future based on the available facts and evidence that we have. And based on the facts and evidence we have now the last thing Russia and China are looking for is a conflict between themselves. They have a partnership which is working for them and they would want no rift at least for now. Russia exports nearly 10% of its products to China and China is a massive consumer of its energy products. China needs Russia for its energy and for having an economic &amp; strategic partner in its other adventures around the world namely Africa and Latin America. 

Russia and China relationship does have its constraints. I have not heard about defense IP theft but that can very well be true, China is well known for this kind of thing. They also have strategic rivalry over control in Central Asia. The question is whether the benefits outweigh the costs for Russia. And as of now, it is. 

The only way to break that alliance is to lift all sanctions on Russia and help them to trade with west freely and get NATO off Russia's border. But that would mean legitimizing Crimea's annexation and granting Russia the permission to be expansionist in Eastern Europe which EU, NATO and US will never agree on. So, ultimately at least for now, I don't see anything changing here."

&gt; Roger Robinson, a former White House official who supports curbing Chinese access to U.S. investors, said 13 of the 20 companies designated by the Defense Department last week as Chinese-military-backed have a presence in the U.S. capital markets.

&gt; The list of PLA-affiliated Chinese enterprises released by the Pentagon is symptomatic of the broader challenge represented by Chinese companies in our capital markets from investor protection, national security, and human rights perspective, said Robinson, referring to the People&amp;#039;s Liberation Army.

2020-07-01 23:47:21,Langernama,"#Thieves use lockdown as cover for EU Parliament burglaries
Parliament’s security service is under fire after scores of legislators have items stolen.

At least 50 MEPs have had computers, tablets and other items stolen from their European Parliament offices while they were away from Brussels during the coronavirus lockdown.

The spate of burglaries appears to have taken place mainly while the building was virtually empty, with thieves rifling through papers and breaking into secure cupboards in MEPs' offices to take valuables.

German MEP Nico Semsrott, who had two laptops stolen, said he is disappointed by the lack of response from the European Parliament's Directorate-General for Security, known as DG SAFE. ""This is a huge scandal, and I don't know why everybody is shutting their mouth,"" he told POLITICO.

""We are pretty sure they [burglars] went through all of our belongings, as it looked quite messy,"" Semsrott said, adding that he had received reports of ""between 40 and 100 MEPs"" having their offices burgled.

Semsrott warned colleagues about the thefts in a group email on Monday and posted a video on YouTube showing how thieves forced open a desk drawer before using a key inside to open a secure cupboard containing the computers (they left the cardboard packaging behind). He said DG SAFE had not warned MEPs about the thefts.

In March, Parliament President David Sassoli introduced strict measures to ban access to outside visitors, and encouraged MEPs and staff to work from their home countries as a precaution against spreading the virus. The Parliament remained mostly empty until May.

A Parliament spokesperson said the assembly had been informed about the burglaries in April, and had ""increased the number of security agents patrolling offices,"" while ""other agents controlled accesses to the building."" She added that DG SAFE is investigating the thefts and is in contact with the Belgian authorities. The spokesperson said the number of victims was not confirmed, but other officials said the number was around 50 MEPs.

Dita Cháranzova, a Czech MEP from the Renew Europe Group and a vice president for security, said she had asked DG SAFE for a report on the break-ins and would raise it at the upcoming meeting of the bureau, which oversees administrative matters.

""For the moment, it is not clear if it is isolated or [if there are] more widespread cases,"" Cháranzova said. ""But the lockdown has increased the chances of such acts as fewer people were in the buildings during the crisis.

""I can only encourage members and staff to report suspected incidents,"" she added.

Massimo Casanova, an MEP from Italy's League, wrote on his Facebook page that he had submitted a complaint to the Parliament after some ""nice unknown people"" broke into his office and ""forced the locks of his cupboards in search of, I don't know what.""

Casanova said ""no item is missing"" but he would investigate if documents had been taken.

According to the recently adopted Parliament discharge report which examines the implementation of the EU budget in 2018, DG SAFE had 756 members of staff and managed 1.5 percent of Parliament’s overall budget in 2018.

According to the annual EU budget for the Parliament, the estimated budget for the security and surveillance of buildings amounts to more than €23 million in appropriations in 2020."

Another thing you have to factor in is that black market goods also have a significant premium over legal goods, in most cases this premium is higher than taxes (and therefore prevents the black market from existing). This premium is caused by the risk to the seller of doing business illegally; the risk of getting caught and punished, the risk of getting robbed, blackmailed or extorted by other criminals (and not having any avenue of legal recourse), and the cost of having to launder your proceeds.

It depends how high the taxes are, I'm sure that some states will make the mistake of putting a massive tax on recreational drugs, thereby keeping the black market alive and totally defeating the purpose of legalisation."

What the commenter above you has neglected to include is that there was no Jewish state at all during the Islamic occupation and hadn't been one since 131AD when Roma annihilated the area and replaced the population with Mediterranean colonists, thereby giving rise to what was known as Syria-Palestine. The Jewish golden age did not, under any circumstances, occur during islamic rule.

Anyway, yes, the jail was fully aware he had been taking Xanax, but could not distribute xanax inside the jail so they gave him a different sort of similar drug which was a disaster that nearly killed him.

While long term outcomes are hard to predict, one very likely immediate benefit would be the destabilization of the larger, well-funded cartels, and a fracturing and division of the cartels and mobs territories and organization.

Without being conspiratorial they are one of the dodgiest groups. Would have been interesting if it was published how they get the funding and the weapons.

&gt; At least 50 people have been killed in Ethiopia after the death of a popular singer sparked huge protests in the Oromia region, a local official has told the BBC. Thousands of fans had gathered to mourn Hachalu Hundessa, who was shot dead on Monday night while driving.

&gt; Many people were injured in Tuesday&amp;#039;s protests and there was &amp;quot;Significant destruction to property,&amp;quot; Getachew Balcha, the spokesperson for the Oromia regional government, told the BBC. The authorities shut down the internet on Tuesday in parts of the country as the protests against his killing spread across Oromia region - there are still reports of unrest on Wednesday.

&gt; In a recent interview with local TV station Oromia Media Network, owned by Mr Jawar, Hachalu had said that people should remember that all the horses seen mounted by old leaders belonged to the people.

&gt; MOSCOW - Russians appeared to have paved the way for Vladimir Putin to stay in power until 2036 by voting overwhelmingly for a package of constitutional changes which will also boost pensions, initial results of a nationwide vote showed on Wednesday.

&gt; Fuller results are due at 1900 GMT. Russians have been encouraged to vote with prize draws offering flats and an ad campaign highlighting other constitutional amendments in the same reform bundle, such as the pensions protection and a de facto ban on same-sex marriages.

&gt; Putin has said he wants a clean vote, something election officials have pledged to deliver.

""The malicious apps mimicked so-called virtual private networks, which are used to set up secure web connections and view prohibited content inside China.

""On the streets of Xinjiang, the police began confiscating Uighurs’ phones. Sometimes, they returned them months later with new spyware installed. Other times, people were handed back entirely different phones. Officials visiting Uighur villages regularly recorded the serial numbers used to identify smartphones.

I know how shit our education system is here in the US and I just want people to open their eyes and realize that Arabs and Islam were NOT always like this. Radical Islam and terrorism are problems that were created in large part due to western intervention in the domestic affairs of middle eastern nations. 

We (the US and Europe over the course of 200yrs) knowingly and intentionally created, funded and protected Wahhabism (the satanic offshoot of Islam that has given birth to groups like Hamas, ISIS, Al Queda and almost all the others). 

We knowingly and intentionally instigated and funded sectarian conflicts and tribal conflicts and successfully got the whole region to be at each other’s throats THEEEEN we turn around and say: “oh they’ve always been like this there’s no hope for them” like WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK... not only does it dehumanize Arabs and vilify Islam but it is also factually incorrect and that’s the most frustrating part of it. 

Look, I don’t have any magical solutions to the radical Islam problem and it definitely is a problem but I think it’s really important for western/white people to acknowledge and understand that: (1) Arabs and Islam have not always been like this and most Arabs and most Muslims are NOT ISIS but are just ordinarily cool people like yourself and (2) WESTERN GOVERNMENTS CREATED THE CANCER THAT IS RADICAL ISLAM and it was likely done intentionally (or at the very least with gross negligence)."

The best way to combat addiction is to educate early and provide adequate health and mental care, not criminalization.

Another thing that legalizing and decriminalization does is getting drugs out of the pockets of the cartels, mafias, and terrorist organizations. People will prefer by and large to go to a shop and maybe have to pay an extra tax on the item than deal with the black market and the shit that comes with it."

And then in California for the most part they did legalize drugs because you can't really get in trouble anymore for being on drugs (ticketable misdemeanor offense, which the police won't bother taking the time to write), and it is a living hell. It did not stop the drug cartels from importing drugs from Mexico because it the drug trade is stronger than ever in California today. As soon as marijuana was legal the drug lords switched all the crops in Mexico straight to poppies for heroin.The town I grew up in, where my whole childhood we never locked our door at night and my mother never took the key out of her car, now a person has to you keep vigilance with cameras recording, and I've got 3 bullet holes in various windows of my home and that's just life no one cares anymore. The other idea I would like to address about drugs being made pure and better for you in this new legal drug fantasy world, well all we have to do is look at the real world of legal pure pharmacueticals. The U.S. sees at least 100,000 (excluding opiod-overdose) deaths a year from the side-effects of properly prescribed and properly taken drugs. This certain drug the legal drug-makers introduced, Xanax, what a nightmare! I just finished watching Jordan Peterson describe how he barely survived this last year simply trying to kick this crazy drug. My own son, when he stopped taking Xanax (because he went to jail) slid into about 2 weeks of hallucinations that became increasingly overwhleming, seizures, and he ended up in a coma in the ICU for a few days. That's a pure legal drug in a more-or-less legalized drug universe, and I gotta say I am not impressed.

During the Middle Ages, Jewish people under Muslim rule experienced tolerance and integration. Some historians refer to this time period as the ""Golden Age"" for the Jews, as more opportunities became available to them. In the context of day-to-day life, Abdel Fattah Ashour, a professor of medieval history at Cairo University, states that Jewish people found solace under Islamic rule during the Middle Ages.The Muslim rule at times didn't fully enforce the Pact of Umar and the traditional Dhimmi status of Jews; i.e., the Jews sometimes, as in eleventh-century Granada, were not second-class citizens. Author Merlin Swartz referred to this time period as a new era for the Jews, stating that the attitude of tolerance led to Jewish integration into Arab-Islamic society.

Social integration allowed Jews to make great advances in new fields, including mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, chemistry and philology, with some even gaining political power under Islamic rule. For example, the vizier of Baghdad entrusted his capital to Jewish bankers, Jews were put in charge of certain parts of maritime and slave trade, and Siraf, the principal port of the caliphate in the 10th century, had a Jewish governor. Increased commercial freedom increased their integration into the Arab marketplace. 

Leon Poliakov writes that in the early ages of Islam, Jews enjoyed great privileges, and their communities prospered. No laws or social barriers restricted their commercial activities, and exclusive trade and craft guilds like those in Europe did not exist. Jews who moved to Muslim lands found themselves free to engage in any profession, resulting in less stigma than in Europe where such restrictions were still in force."

&gt; India will not allow Chinese companies to participate in highway projects, including those through joint ventures, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Wednesday amid border standoff with China.

&gt; &amp;quot;We will not give permission to joint ventures that have Chinese partners for road construction. We have taken a firm stand that if they come via joint venture in our country, we will not allow it,&amp;quot; Mr. Gadkari told PTI in an interview.

&gt; The Road Transport, Highways and MSME minister said a policy will be out soon banning Chinese firms and relaxing norms for Indian companies to expand their eligibility criteria for participation in highway projects.

2020-07-01 10:10:00,Langernama,"#Macron wants greater European involvement in Sahel counterterrorism
French president heads to G5 Sahel summit.

PARIS — More European countries need to get involved in the fight against terrorism in the Sahel region of Africa, according to French President Emmanuel Macron.

""It is our desire to Europeanise the fight against terrorism in the Sahel,"" Macron said in a statement to the press upon arriving in Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania, on Tuesday to take part in a G5 Sahel summit that Spain, Germany, Italy and the EU will also participate in.

The G5 Sahel is a framework through which five African nations — Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger — cooperate in the fight against terrorist Islamist groups in the region and on development issues. Tuesday's summit aims to consolidate recent military gains, help local governments reassert state control over areas in which terrorists have been present, and reaffirm local political support for military intervention, according to an official in Macron's office.

France has been heavily involved in the fight against Islamists in the region since launching Operation Barkhane in 2014. Macron has been pushing for increased European military involvement alongside his forces, and though the process has been long and slow, some European countries have increased their participation.

""When France gets involved, it's Europe that gets involved,"" Macron said Tuesday.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is attending the summit in Mauritania, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and European Council President Charles Michel will be participating via videoconference, according to Macron.

A task force called Takuba, mainly staffed with European special forces, was launched in March 2019. Deployments are expected to start by the end of 2020, according to another person in Macron's office.

French forces, acting on American intelligence, killed the top al-Qaeda leader in North Africa, Abdelmalek Droukdel, in an operation in Mali on June 3.

""Over the past six months we’ve achieved real successes in the fight against terrorism,"" Macron said, adding it was thanks to scaling up of information-sharing and the performance of African militaries. ""It is to consolidate these advances that I am here."""

2020-07-01 07:32:31,DCFY7439,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday sought to reassert America’s waning influence on the world stage, challenging the U.N. Security Council to extend a U.N. arms embargo that is due to expire in October. Instead, America’s top diplomat received a scolding from friends and foes alike in the 15-nation council, which roundly criticized Washington for withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal two years ago without a clear plan to limit Tehran’s nuclear activities.

On a day when the European Union pointedly excluded the United States from a “safe list” of countries permitted to travel to the 27-member bloc, the council’s chilly reception of Pompeo added to a portrait of an increasingly isolated United States and underscored how little deference other countries pay the Trump administration as it faces a grim reelection contest. The U.N. debate came amid a sharpening blowback in Washington to revelations that the Trump administration failed to act on months of intelligence warnings that Russia offered Taliban fighters bounties to kill U.S. and coalition troops in Afghanistan. 

The pointedly critical tone of the debate saw Germany accusing Washington of violating international law by withdrawing from the nuclear pact, while Berlin aligned itself with China’s claim that the United States has no right to reimpose U.N. sanctions on Iran. Russia’s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, compared U.S. sanctions on Iran to the killing of George Floyd, saying they were akin to “putting a knee to one’s neck.” 

The dispute centered on the fate of the nearly moribund 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which capped Iran’s ability to develop a nuclear weapon but which the United States abandoned in May 2018. European parties to the deal, like Iran, want to keep it alive; the Trump administration wants to kill it before the election, lest any future Democratic administration bring it back to life. 

The latest battleground is one provision of that deal, the planned expiry in October of a U.N. arms embargo on Iran—one of the sweeteners of the nuclear deal. U.S. allies, including the security council’s five European states, share Washington’s concern about Iran’s arms trade, though Europe’s own arms embargo is set to continue until 2023 regardless. But they worry that extending the U.N. arms embargo, in clear violation of the pact signed in 2015, would drive Tehran to kick out nuclear inspectors and set the stage for an even quicker development of its nuclear program. 

“The [Iran nuclear pact], which is the result of compromise, can of course be seen as an instrument that can be improved,” France’s U.N. ambassador, Nicolas de Rivière, told the council. “There is as yet no serious alternative to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, and its disappearance would improve neither the regional situation nor the security of our populations.”

Since President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the deal, Iran has violated key tenets of the accord by increasing its stockpiles of nuclear fuel and resuming its enrichment of uranium, according to assessments from the International Atomic Energy Agency. 

At the opening of Tuesday’s virtual session, Rosemary DiCarlo, a former U.S. State Department official who serves as U.N. undersecretary-general for political affairs, praised the nuclear pact as a “significant achievement of multilateral diplomacy and dialogue” and expressed “regret” over the U.S. decision to withdraw, noting that Iran was in compliance with the pact before Trump’s abrupt decision to pull the plug.

But she also expressed regret that since July 2019 Iran has violated key provisions of the nuclear pact, surpassing limits on the size of its stockpiles of heavy water and low-enriched uranium and engaging in prohibited nuclear research and development activities. 

DiCarlo also flagged Iran’s role in missile and drone attacks against Saudi Arabia, as well as arms shipments to proxies in Yemen that appear to run afoul of the provisions of the key U.N. Security Council resolution that endorsed the nuclear deal. 

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif dismissed claims that Iranian-made weapons were being transferred to Yemen and elsewhere in violation of U.N. sanctions. 

“The international community in general and the U.N. Security Council in particular are facing an important decision,” Zarif told the council. “Do we maintain respect of the rule of law, or do we return to the law of the jungle by surrendering to the whims of an outlaw bully?”

The Trump administration this month circulated a draft resolution to extend the arms embargo on Iran, but veto-wielding China and Russia signaled they would not support the U.S. plan. European powers also reacted coolly to the resolution and are expected to introduce their own stopgap proposal to extend parts of the arms embargo for up to six months. It is unclear if the United States would support their plan. 

The Trump administration has charged Tehran with playing a destabilizing role in the Middle East through its support of proxy terrorist groups in the region. Pompeo said that if the United Nations did not extend the arms embargo, it would pave the way for Iran to procure advanced military hardware from Russia and China that would undercut regional stability and potentially threaten capitals in Europe and even South Asia—reiterating misleading claims he made last week about the operational range of high-end Russian and Chinese fighters. 

“If you fail to act, Iran will be free to purchase Russian-made fighter jets that can strike up to a 3,000-kilometer radius, putting cities like Riyadh, New Delhi, Rome, and Warsaw in Iranian crosshairs,” Pompeo told the council during Tuesday’s virtual meeting. 

“Don’t just take it from the United States; listen to countries in the region. From Israel to the Gulf, countries in the Middle East—who are most exposed to Iran’s predations—are speaking with one voice: Extend the arms embargo,” he said. "

2020-07-01 07:27:28,TheHalfinStream,"Again, I never said I support the USA. the police has in fact been cracking down on protestors, but the army and national guard disapprove, as evident by many members of both organizations posting their disapproval all over social media. The police has been mostly targeting the violent protestors, but the evil cops have been hurting the peaceful protestors a lot.

Nextly, not comparing china to the USA here, but they have been kinda brutally oppressing Hong Kong for months.

And lastly, why should china be a socialist country? By all means, socialism and communism is great for countries struggling to get an economic foothold, but nations such as china should definitely be capitalistic due to their huge industrial powerhouse. They could maintain the wealth they have now while providing citizens with a ton more freedom under a system like Taiwan's."

To say nothing of the USA openly killing political dissidents before, like Fred Hampton, and persecuting others like Chelsea Manning or Julian Assange.

My problem is that you're focusing in on the crimes of one nation while ignoring the more powerful ones that do identical things, almost certainly for ideological reasons. And then exaggerating those crimes to compare said nation to literally the most villainous country ever.

Yeah no. Those comparisons have their place in academic arenas, and when you're teaching children (""to forbid analogy is to forbid learning""), but when you're on an ostensible news page it's annoying and bad.

By all means, tear down the CCP, and I'll support you in that endeavor. China should be a democratic nation (preferably a socialist one), but it isn't. But when you're talking about the actual facts, having American nationalists compare China to Nazi Germany is an obvious attempt at yellow peril and establishing legitimacy for military action. I'll have no part in it, no matter the moralizing to the contrary."

China isn't exactly a picnic, and its handling of minorities can charitably be called ethnic cleansing, but the scale and intensity of their crimes do not remotely approach Nazi Germany. Nor do America or Russia currently approach it.

I'm not exactly sure why dog eating is listed either, considering that most developed nations eat massive amounts of meat products. Eating dogs isn't magically worse than eating a pig or cow, all of them are abused.

80% of the things you can visit have become overcrowded tourist traps. Almost all the historic and cultural spots have all been rebuilt and look like theme parks now.  The rest are in remote places that are hard to access. 

Now China is nice for its big cities and that cyberpunk feel in some places but nowadays all the major cities have been more or less sanitized and aren't as lively as before,  the worst example of that being beijing which has become a soulless city in the last few years. 

Finally there isn't much traditional culture left in today's China (especially in the North),  Taiwan and HK (RIP)  are better representatives of traditional Chinese culture since the culture has been better preserved there."

The point is though, if the governing body is going to recognize a language as official then they need to have government documents translated into that language.

&gt;  
&gt;Not  to mention that counting GDP is completely misleading: Hong Kong is  contributing indirectly, hugely, as escape hatch for China for financial  and technology transfer from the US, which is being closed after Hong  Kong’s special status is gone.

These troubles are little different from those faced by the US, Germany, Russia, Japan or many other countries. And while they are troublesome, they are hardly the sort of problem that causes an entire system to collapse. They are problems that can be overcome, especially in a non-capitalist system where the state wields so much power over all aspects of the economy.

And as for HK's indirect contributions, China has long been developing Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing to serve as alternatives to HK, and the loss of special status is really only relevant to the US, which while a great power, is only one country among many and therefore only has a limited impact. Other countries most likely will continue business as usual in HK regardless of its status within China. Economical incentives will be too strong for many to ignore, especially in Europe which historically has always taken a much less confrontational and adversarial stance towards China than the US. China still remains a critical partner of the EU, especially as a way to counterbalance US influence, so I would not expect too much from that corner.

&gt; The world is [decoupling from China](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_titties/comments/hiei7c/us_announces_end_of_hong_kongs_special_status/fwhtynd/) as we speak, unlike 10 years ago. 

Decoupling? Hardly. What we have seen so far is incredibly minor and without effect on the vast majority of trade between China and other countries. Banning Huawei from constructing 5G networks in a few countries isn't going to impact China's GDP. A handful of half-assed sanctions by only the US on a few Chinese companies isn't going to impact China's GDP. Nothing India does is going to impact China's GDP. These measures are mostly hollow shells, symbolic politics that are meant to sound good but have no real impact. The nature and interconnectedness of our modern global economic system means that a true decoupling from China would absolutely devastate the economy of not only China, but also that of the US or any other country attempting it and cripple it for decades (if not centuries) to come. No democratic politician is brave enough to commit to such a kamikaze approach to geopolitics.

Not to mention that once the trade war between Trump and Xi has blown over, the US is likely going to go back to full business with China. Chinese money is just too attractive and good for the economy, and greed is too much ingrained in human nature. 

Overall, I am pretty pessimistic about the future. I wish it were different, but the situation of Hong Kong is dire. The PRC has grown incredibly powerful and influential in the past two decades, and ultimately, the economic and geopolitical interests of many of the world's nations will weigh stronger than their moral objections to China's actions. I just don't see a way out of this."

The Germans in turn attacked the Russian navy at the black sea with Ottoman Flags. So, before the Ottomans could react or something, the Entete(Russia, France and UK) declared war on them thus they got in a war at two fronts while having internal instability and a sick economy.

Just because they allowed some German ships to dock at their ports."

It is the main reason, due to the fact that that pandemic is more likely to have emerged in the US and spread widely in the trenches of WW1. Spain stood out as having a lot of cases due to other nations denying outbreaks due to wartime propaganda. 

Failures can occur in any nation that lead to an outbreak of disease; Be it BSE in the UK, H1N1 in Mexico etc. Attacking China with conspiracy theories over this outbreak damages important and valid responses to their very real, malevolent actions against HK, its neighbours, and its ethnic minorities, as well as its concerning geopolitical movements.

It is incredibly important for nations to develop resilient and state sponsored manufacturing sectors to withstand international calamities and reduce dependencies, but global trade is inevitable and vital due to scarcity of vital resources. Attacking one nation for actions conducted equally by others shrouds perspective. Isolationism helps noone."

[[Image](https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/06/w_56184108-800x450.jpg): _""When Germany and France are united, Europe is not united, but when France and Germany are not united, Europe is not particularly well off,"" said the German chancellor, thus underlining the significance of Franco-German cooperation. [EPA-EFE | Hayoung Jeon/ Pool]_

**In a show of unity, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel met on Monday (29 June) and reaffirmed their commitment to the EU Recovery Fund, voicing hope that EU leaders would overcome their current differences. [EURACTIV Germany reports](https://www.euractiv.de/section/eu-aussenpolitik/news/merkel-und-macron-zeigen-einigkeit-vor-kritischem-eu-gipfel/).**

Macron and Merkel held their first face-to-face meeting since the outbreak of the pandemic at Meseberg, north of Berlin. The two said the Franco-German motor is stronger than ever but warned that “there is still a long way to go” before an agreement is reached among EU027.

The focus was on the EU recovery fund that France and Germany jointly presented on 18 May. For Germany, that day marked a radical ‘U-turn’ as Merkel had until then stood for austerity and fiscal prudence. Her support for a grant-based reconstruction plan means that the more frugal member states had lost an important ally.

The fund and the EU budget will be the main topic at the next EU summit on 17-18 July, where heads of state and government will meet face to face in Brussels for the first time since the pandemic began.

And just three weeks ahead of this summit, Merkel and Macron are signalling that their unity did not end with the joint initiative.

##A new German will to reform

“When Germany and France are united, Europe is not united, but when France and Germany are not united, Europe is not particularly well off,” the German chancellor told a joint press conference, underlining the significance of Franco-German cooperation.

Merkel and Macron also demonstrated unity with regard to the German EU Council presidency, which starts on 1 July. According to Merkel, the two sides aim to “play a joint role” in major issues such as digitisation and climate protection in the coming weeks. They would also “contribute to providing a positive impetus,” she added.

The chancellor also described the Conference on the Future of Europe as a project that links Germany and France in that the starting and finishing points could fall within the respective national presidencies. In between, she said, there had to be clarity about what ” we want to change in Europe”.

While Merkel had often been accused of being too inflexible and hesitant in responding to the French president’s reform proposals in recent years, it now looks as if the chancellor is trying to make her legacy as an EU designer in her last term in office.

In recent months, the chancellor has repeatedly stressed that the EU urgently needs reforms and that treaty changes should no longer be “taboo”.

##Agreement already in July

Macron emphasised the need to make rapid progress on the EU financial framework and recovery plan. “An agreement must be reached in July, that is our top priority,” he said, as “waiting would not make things easier.”

Macron also stressed that grants rather than loans should be at “the heart” of the European recovery plan because loans would only contribute to the economic difficulties that already exist. For this reason, the plan proposed by France and Germany represents a good balance between jointly borrowed debt and grants, he said.

The French president thus increased the pressure on the so-called “Frugal Four” – Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden. “The Frugals are the net beneficiaries of the single market. It benefits them much more than others,” he said, stressing that it was in their interest to adopt this recovery plan.

##Litmus test for Berlin

Failure to adopt the recovery plan would “exacerbate all problems” and fuel populism, the chancellor had warned in an interview with European newspapers on Saturday (27 June).

And if France and Germany succeed in overcoming the reluctance of the “Frugal Four” to accept the economic recovery plan in its current form, the German EU presidency will be partially successful.

Germany already has France’s backing during the presidency. “We will stand by you during the German Presidency,” said Macron.

France itself will hold the EU Council Presidency in the first half of 2022, meaning it will coincide with the next presidential and parliamentary elections.

##A border carbon tax

The two also showed a common front on the proposal for an EU carbon border tax, an idea that other states do not necessarily support.

“It is a common position [with France] that we need such a tax. It must be compatible with the World Trade Organisation,” Merkel said. It is not insignificant, she added, because the EU must protect itself against countries that want to import products with a high carbon footprint.

The tax was mentioned by the European Commission as a possible means of repaying the joint debt, for which the two countries must also overcome the at times strong resistance from other member states."

2020-06-30 19:48:57,dj_meatstorm,Dude this is a ww3 scenario thought experiment first off. Secondly I even said straight up in the comment you're responding to that it wouldn't be worth the damage to the world economy.
2020-06-30 19:45:30,tamsen_ikard,"Hong Kong still has:

1. Separate Border with no unlimited migration from rest of China
2. Drives on the left side
3. Common Law when it comes to businesses
4. Foreigner Judges
5. A separate currency
6. Doesn't pay any taxes to central Government
7. No need to provide military service which is mandatory for rest of China
8. One of the lowest taxes in the world
9. Separate law for property and finance

Hong Kong is far from over. In fact, they have it really good. They pay nothing for defense, which is the biggest expense for any government. They just took out the anti-China pro-western political elements. But things that appeal about hong kong such as a separate law for Finance and business and also the border is there. That's what One country two systems is all about. It was about preserving the hong kong financial/economic system.   


The Joint declaration talks about Hong Kong's Capitalist system being preserved, not politics. Hong Kong will slowly become like Singapore, mostly tame, docile and focused on making money. Still a playground for western companies."
2020-06-30 19:45:21,Auromeda,"&gt;I did not derail the conversation.

You did though. Our first interaction was you initiating a conversation with me by unapologetically saying “youre an idiot”. Tha

&gt;I asked you to elaborate, and you replied with a stupid joke instead.

You asked me to elaborate on *“which oil”* I was talking about. It wasn’t my joke that was stupid. It was your question."
2020-06-30 19:44:28,fragrance-harbour,"&gt;The first problem with that is that  the Chinese economy isn't declining. At least not nearly enough to cause  trouble for the CCP. And HK is only responsible for less than 3% of  China's GDP, so the impact of anything happening in HK may be limited.

It is [declining in the long run](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_titties/comments/hiei7c/us_announces_end_of_hong_kongs_special_status/fwftfd6/) with [immediate signs of troubles](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_titties/comments/hiei7c/us_announces_end_of_hong_kongs_special_status/fwg13g5/).

Not to mention that counting GDP is completely misleading: Hong Kong is contributing indirectly, hugely, as escape hatch for China for financial and technology transfer from the US, which is being closed after Hong Kong’s special status is gone.

&gt;The  second problem is that an economical crash of China would cause a  similar crash in the entire world much like what happened in the US in  2007-2008 (or earlier in the 1930s), and even more so for countries  dependent on international trade or on China for their manufacturing.

The world is [decoupling from China](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime_titties/comments/hiei7c/us_announces_end_of_hong_kongs_special_status/fwhtynd/) as we speak, unlike 10 years ago.

&gt;The  third problem is that an economic crash might not necessarily lead to  the downfall of the CCP. They have survived lean times before, and their  hold on power is now quite absolute. Who is to say they won't just  survive again?

No body can say for sure, not you or me. But the Chinese population was extremely poor back then, so they could stand it. It is much harder to go back now."
2020-06-30 19:43:21,Henryman2,"What the actual fuck. You do know that a blockade is considered an act of war under international law, so China can and would retaliate? The implications of this could be nuclear war. Read up on the Cuban missle crisis.

Also, trade with China is a significant part of our economy, so that would be destroyed. Then, our country would go bankrupt because we rely on them for credit. I’m all for not relying on China, but how can you say something like this without thinking of the basic implications."

&gt; HONG KONG - Beijing unveiled the national security law it is imposing on Hong Kong on Tuesday, punishing crimes of secession and sedition with up to life in prison and stoking concern it heralds a more authoritarian era for China&amp;#039;s most freewheeling city.

&gt; China&amp;#039;s central government will exercise jurisdiction over the enforcement of the national security legislation and it will trump Hong Kong law in the event of a conflict, according to the law, confirming draft details released this month.

&gt; Some pro-Beijing officials have described the national security law as Hong Kong&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;Second return&amp;quot; after authorities failed to tame the city politically after its handover from British rule on July 1, 1997.

Additionally, China has demonstrated both the capability and the willingness to blow up satellites.

So the top end of casualties of a war with China would be nuclear strikes on S.Korea, Japan, Australia, India, most of the US west coast, and we'd probably have Kepler syndrome preventing any safe exploration of space for the next century or so.

&gt; Hongkongers convicted under the city&amp;#039;s new national security law could be imprisoned for life.

&gt; Acts of secession, subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces will carry a minimum of 10 years and maximum of life in prison for serious cases, according to the text which was gazetted at just after 11pm. Arson and vandalising public transport with an intent to intimidate the Hong Kong government or Chinese government for political purposes will constitute acts of terrorism under the new law.

&gt; It states that Hong Kong will have no jurisdiction over the new offices in Hong Kong, nor can it oversee the behaviour, search or inspect law enforcement personnel.

I never said it should be banned because it is pro-Hindu. It should be banned because it reports false news. If you go through the links I have provided you will find more than enough proof. 

You can say that Al-Jazeera reports news in a questionable manner and have a pro-Islamic agenda but OpIndia is a news site which have completely distorted the truth a number of times, I have never seen any media do it at OpIndia level.

2020-06-30 16:50:29,firen777,"Never say a disease MUST be named after the region of origin. I just find the ccp amusing that they are the one who simultaneously yell racism and commit heavily on discrimination, whilst proceed to waste the world valuable time banging their head to come up with a name not to offend ~~Chinese~~ the ccp.

Also, to answer your question...

AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome doesn't seem to have a clear cut origin. Naming it this way seems fine, tho, since it descriptively tell you what this disease does to a patient.

Ebola... well, clue's in the name, first discovered near the Ebola river in Congo, who still need help fighting against this virus.

Swine flu... which swine flu you are referring to? But either way, it is a collective term used to describe influenza originated from pig, so pretty appropriate name if you ask me.

Even more appropriate if you can pin point their genetic make up, which is where the name H1N1 stands.

COVID-19 stands for Coronavirus disease 2019... ummm... useful, I guess?

Again, my point still stands. No other government in history cry foul when a disease named after them. It's not even supposed to be political until the ccp politicized the name. Unless the government is directly responsible for the pandemic, no country on earth would place blame based on name alone for what suppose to be a natural disaster.

Almost 80% of seats in the election were won by pro-democracy. The biggest pro-democracy victory ever despite the whole election being rigged against them. And she opened her mouth and said strong leaders will ignore election results. 

She said she wants to quit but China won't let her. And she opened her mouth and got mad when people said she is controlled by China. 

She was asked why doesn't she show any sadness to the teenagers killed and raped by police. She opened her mouth and said she only cares about Hong Kong's stability and not its people. 

She refused to close the border to China when Coronavirus was starting in December and January as she said it would be racist. But she closed the border to Koreans and Italians. 

When asked how can she help secure Hong Kong's autonomy and democracy. She said it is impossible under China. And then got upset when people said independence should be an option instead. 

She was asked to investigate police brutality, corruption and rape. She said it would be bad for police moral to do so. 

When Hong Kong people went missing she said there was no way it was a result of China and if it was true she would be angry. When Chinese police said the next day that they were kidnapped by Chinese police. She said she supports the Chinese police. 

Even her own husband came out and said she is killing Hong Kong and needs to step down.

She really needs to go. She is the biggest reason for the boost in Hong Kong independence support in Hong Kong. If she isn't careful she will be arrested for stare subversion.

2020-06-30 13:05:20,Longsheep,"I was born before 1997 in Hong Kong. I know the difference, internet expert.


&gt; Their comment is replying to a previous comment that claims colonial rule gave people in Hong Kong basic freedoms. 

Democracy lacked both before and after 1997, while freedom was far greater before 1997. The media and press were allowed to publish anything they want without oppression since 1971. You did not get arrested for insulting the police as long as you do not attack them.

&gt; I notice you don't even address the issue of people in Hong Kong not being able to vote under British rule.

The whole point of the fucking Sino-British Joint Declaration was to guarantee democracy under a high degree of autonomy after 1997. Britain **negotiated** with China to get them. Universal suffrage was promised, but delayed for 20 years and finally denied by the CCP. It was all written in the document. Of course, it was written in a time when USSR was still a threat to everyone and China tried to stay friendly with the West, Britain included.

&gt; Nowhere in the wikipedia article you linked to does it say that the police weren't using live rounds. In fact it states that many protesters were shot and killed. According to the article, there were 51 casualties during the riots. Many demonstrators were beaten to death by British forces after they were arrested, some were shot to death and one person was shot and then drowned. 

**Did you read the list? At least half of the casualties were killed by leftists instead of the government.** The leftists were basically terrorists, think of IRA. Some were killed when they tried to kill and maim people. Those are separate incidents from the large scale protests, which were actually quite small compared to 2014 and 2019.

&gt; Whether the conspiracy of the protests being actively supported by communist forces is true or not (I don't know too much about that), it doesn't take away from the fact that they had legitimate concerns against British rule.

They wanted Hong Kong integrated into China, that is far beyond just opposing policies. And the 1967 protest was opposed by most civilians. Or else how would you think the police gained such support afterward? They were seen as heroes from 1967-2000 and always were the good guys in movies.

&gt; They didn't have democracy then and they're slowly losing it now. The CCP are doing horrid things. But let's not start painting the British as saints here.

Fuck you for even comparing the two. Britain did bad stuff in many colonies, but Hong Kong was among the most successful ones. Literally no one said bad things about the governors since  WWII. Do you even know how much UK has done to build up Hong Kong? Most advanced public transit, public housing and medical system in Asia? On any given date 1950-1997, British Hong Kong was more prosperous, more secure and more opportunistic than any Asian country excluding Japan. China was making countless political ""struggles"" that killed millions."

&gt; Hong Kong was handed back to China from British control in 1997, but with a unique agreement which guaranteed certain freedoms.

&gt; The bill has sparked demonstrations in Hong Kong and drawn international condemnation since it was announced by Beijing in May. But China says the law is needed to tackle separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign elements - and rejects criticism as interference in its affairs.

2020-06-30 12:55:56,GreatRolmops,"I can see a few problems with that strategy.

The first problem with that is that the Chinese economy isn't declining. At least not nearly enough to cause trouble for the CCP. And HK is only responsible for less than 3% of China's GDP, so the impact of anything happening in HK may be limited.

The second problem is that an economical crash of China would cause a similar crash in the entire world much like what happened in the US in 2007-2008 (or earlier in the 1930s), and even more so for countries dependent on international trade or on China for their manufacturing.

The third problem is that an economic crash might not necessarily lead to the downfall of the CCP. They have survived lean times before, and their hold on power is now quite absolute. Who is to say they won't just survive again?"

2020-06-30 12:38:09,mutton_biriyani,"&gt;Because he twisted the events using the CCP's narrative.

Their comment is replying to a previous comment that claims colonial rule gave people in Hong Kong basic freedoms. The original comment was trying to paint a rosy picture of British rule by contrasting it with the current situation with the CCP. The British didn't even give the people of Hong Kong the basic freedom of democratic elections until much later when it became convenient to do so. Their comment's reasoning behind pointing that out here doesn't seem like 'twisting' to me.

&gt;&gt;You mean like when they were treated as second class citizens and couldn't vote until the 80s and only allowed to do so because they were about to hand it back? Even then still not be able to vote for the governor because it was appointed by the British?

&gt;Yet millions of refugees rushed to Hong Kong from the Mainland because it was still 1000 times better than living under communism. Thousands died trying and the government collected bodies that drowned in the ocean every day. They tried to swim to Hong Kong but failed.

I notice you don't even address the issue of people in Hong Kong not being able to vote under British rule. So I don't understand why you put that part from their comment in quotes like you were writing a response to it. Their comment never claimed that life under communism isn't horrible. They're trying to point out that life under colonial rule is also horrible because they were replying to an earlier comment that tried to make it sound like it wasn't. 


&gt;&gt;Or do you mean like when in 1967 there were widespread demonstrations and protests against British rule in the colony led by left-wing groups and trade unions and these were put down very violently by British colonial forces.


&gt;The [1967 Leftist Riot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967_Hong_Kong_riots) was an insurrection organized by the CCP 5th column in Hong Kong. The rioters were well armed and funded by the CCP. Thousands of bombs have been detonated in the street killing dozens and wounding thousands, most were innocent civilians or naive supporters who failed to set up the bomb properly. Conspiracy theory aside (some claim many ""disappeared"" after getting arrested), very few people were actually killed by the police as they did not use live round.

Nowhere in the wikipedia article you linked to does it say that the police weren't using live rounds. In fact it states that many protesters were shot and killed. According to the article, there were 51 casualties during the riots. Many demonstrators were beaten to death by British forces after they were arrested, some were shot to death and one person was shot and then drowned. The British had also violently suppressed an earlier peaceful demonstration in 1966. When peaceful demonstration is met with violence, it tends to become violent. Their comment was pointing out that people in Hong Kong were protesting against British rule. Whether the conspiracy of the protests being actively supported by communist forces is true or not (I don't know too much about that), it doesn't take away from the fact that they had legitimate concerns against British rule. They didn't have democracy then and they're slowly losing it now. The CCP are doing horrid things. But let's not start painting the British as saints here."

2020-06-30 12:21:45,echinguun,"&gt;They didn't abandon Poland. They were operating under a different paradigm to Germany. Britain and especially France were stuck in the World War 1 mindset, where offenses span over months and gains per day was listed in meters, not kilometres. They expected Poland to hold out for several months whilst they organized a ""proper"" offensive. This isn't as stupid as it initially sounds, for reasons I briefly touched upon before.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_betrayal?wprov=sfla1 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Polish_military_alliance?wprov=sfla1

&gt;Another British diplomat, Alexander Cadogan wrote in his diary: ""Naturally, our guarantee does not give any help to Poland. It can be said that it was cruel to Poland, even cynical.""

A comment by a British diplomat literally confirming that they did indeed plan to abandon Poland.

&gt;On 2 August 1939 Great Britain finally agreed to grant Poland a military loan of £9 million, which was less than Turkey received at the same time. Poland had asked for a loan of £60 million.

""Let's help a neutral country more, with no major threats, instead of our ally, who is sandwiched between two of the most tyrannical governments in Europe.""

&gt;Additionally representatives of the Western powers made several military promises to Poland, including such fantastic designs as those made by British General William Edmund Ironside in his July 1939 talks with Marshall Rydz-Śmigły who promised an attack from the direction of Black Sea, or placing a British aircraft carrier in the Baltic. 

No British ships ever came to help.

&gt;On 4 September, during a Franco-British meeting in France, it was decided that no major land or air operations against Germany would take place, and afterwards French military leader Maurice Gamelin issued orders prohibiting Polish military envoys Lieutenant Wojciech Fyda and General Stanisław Burhardt-Bukacki from contacting him. In his post-war diaries, General Edmund Ironside, the chief of the Imperial General Staff, commented on French promises: ""The French had lied to the Poles in saying they are going to attack. There is no idea of it"". 

Straight up lying.

&gt;The French initiated full mobilisation and began the limited Saar Offensive on 7 September but halted short of the German defensive lines and then withdrew to their own defences around 13 September. Poland was not notified of this decision. Instead, Gamelin informed by dispatch marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły that half of his divisions were in contact with the enemy, and that French advances had forced the Wehrmacht to withdraw at least six divisions from Poland. The Polish military envoy to France, general Stanisław Burhardt-Bukacki, upon receiving the text of the message sent by Gamelin, alerted marshal Śmigły: ""I received the message by general Gamelin. Please don't believe a single word in the dispatch"".

Also lying here.

And in WW1, if you encounter no major resistance, the plan was just keep advancing, not advance and then retreat behind your fortifications.

&gt;First and foremost, France's industry and population was mauled in WW1. Whilst it's Industry primarily recovered, it's population didn't. To make matters worse, France's industry was almost entirely in the regions close to the borders for Germany. 

The same with Germany, the Ruhr region was one of the most industrial regions in the world and source of many interwar disputes and it borders France.

&gt;Germany, on the otherhand, came out of WW1 with a relatively intact population. When you add in the fact that the German birthrate was always higher than France's, you were left with a situation where Germany was always going to be able to win in a battle of attrition vs France. This left only one real option for France; to turtle down behind the extremely heavy defence of the Maginot line, and send it's best divisions into the Low countries to face off against the Germans. Their plan was to utilize the combined industry power of France and England, which was far greater than that of Germany's, to grind Germany out in a battle of attrition that was won not through population pool, but by superior artillery and tanks. 

Yeah, I know. The plan was okay in terms of the information available to them. BUT if that was their plan, they should have expressly notified their allies like Poland of it.


&gt;This is part of the reason why Poland fell so swiftly - despite being actually better prepared for a fluid war than the western Allies, they simply didn't have the actual equipment to fight the kind of war the Germans were fighting.

Poland also lost quickly because, you know, full mobilization of their forces was vetoed by UK and France, it's estimated Poland lost 1/3 of its fighting potential due to this debacle.

&gt;The other part of the reason Poland fell so swiftly was the Soviet Union.

However, Germany wasn't playing by the same rules. Compared to France and Britain, where the veterans rested on their laurels and glory and ignored the lower ranked newcomers with their innovative ideas, Germany wholeheartedly welcomed innovators like Heinz Guiderian, whose ideas (when combined with other German generals) led to the formation of the modern Armoured Division. While their tanks weren't as good as the allied counterparts, they were better trained and organized, and were equipped with radios, giving them much greater tactical flexibility over their allied counterparts. These advantages meant a much more swifter and fluid war could be fought, where armies could be destroyed in a matter of days due to supply lines being cut and chains of command being disrupted. This is part of the reason why Poland fell so swiftly - despite being actually better prepared for a fluid war than the western Allies, they simply didn't have the actual equipment to fight the kind of war the Germans were fighting.

My perspective is that western societies focus on individual freedoms and rights - perfectly fine. On the contrary, China focuses on unity, and conformity. You can see it through its policies (Uighurs, censorship etc).

The problem with HK is that the younger generation views itself more culturally aligned with western values.  No matter what the CCP does, it is going to upset alot of people. 

My view is that the NSL is needed since HK is part of China and it has the right to enforce measures regarding to national security. Now whether it can be a tool for the CCP to silence dissent is another issue (which I see as unlikely as the law seems to have safeguards).

Living in a society is always about what freedoms people are willing to give up in exchange for prosperity and security and sadly in HK's case, values which HK citizens treasure are not in line with the CCPs.

To me, it is more of a cultural and economic issue."
2020-06-30 10:39:10,Langernama,I wonder what else happened in that 1-on-1 call between Macron and Putin...
2020-06-30 10:38:35,Langernama,"#Macron accuses Turkey of ‘criminal responsibility’ in Libya
French president treads more softly on Russia’s role in the country.

French President Emmanuel Macron accused Turkey on Monday of bearing ""criminal responsibility"" for its actions in Libya, further escalating a war of words between Paris and Ankara over recent weeks.

Speaking at a press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel outside Berlin, Macron accused Turkey of failing to abide by pledges made at a conference on Libya in the German capital in January.

""I consider that today Turkey doesn't respect any of the commitments made at the Berlin conference, increased its military presence in Libya since then and massively reimported jihadist fighters from Syria,"" Macron told reporters at Schloss Meseberg, a German government guest house. ""I think it's a historic and criminal responsibility for a member of NATO.""

France and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at loggerheads for months over their conflicting policies in Libya, the Eastern Mediterranean and Northeast Syria.

On June 10, French and Turkish vessels came dangerously close to an armed clash in the Mediterranean when Turkish frigates escorting a cargo ship refused to let a French frigate under NATO command inspect the cargo.

Macron has also alleged Turkey's intervention in Libya increases the terrorist threat to Europe, and its drilling agreements in the Eastern Mediterranean threaten the territorial integrity of EU member countries such as Cyprus and Greece.

Macron was much less strident when discussing Russia's role in Libya. For the second time in just over a week, responding to a question about Russian intervention in the country, he raised only the activities of the mercenary Wagner Group, omitting any mention of [Russian warplanes](https://twitter.com/USAfricaCommand/status/1265240771269197830?s=20) sent to Libya in recent weeks.

""Russia doesn't claim to be intervening in Libya ... Turkey claims it — it is its official boats, its military, its policy,"" Macron said in explaining his assertion that Turkey is responsible for ""the main foreign intervention"" in Libya.

Macron had a two-hour, one-on-one videoconference call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, a format requested by the Russian side, according to an Elysée official.

During that conversation, Macron condemned the activities of the Wagner Group in Libya, according to the official. The official was unable to say whether he had also discussed the presence of Russian warplanes."

Both tanks have similar firepower (Type 99A's main gun is derived from a Russian design, while T-90S's main gun is well literally a Russian gun). The Type 99A does have an advantage in mobility, and its turret has an interesting wedge design that is radically different from Soviet/Russian engineering habits. Meanwhile both tanks reportedly have advanced targeting systems, active protection systems, and advanced armor schemes. There simply isn't that much info on the Type 99A to make a judgement, and imo it probably comes down to which side has better training, strategy and force multipliers."

They also realised in that moment they were woefully underprepared for war. You also need to realize that at the time, the Great War was still fresh in the memories of both England and France, and both were eager to delay or avoid war for as long as possible. France in particular lost almost an entire Generation in the first world war. So there wasn't a lot France or England could do to stop Hitler from claiming Czechslovakia and Memel in quick succession after that aside from preparing faster.

2020-06-30 06:48:32,fragrance-harbour,"&gt;Debt isn't crippling the USA (although other factors are). It won't hurt China either. They'll just run the maths over and over to make it all work on a huge bubble. (Look at their ghost cities for example.)

Debt just caused hyperinflation in [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) and [Venezuela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Venezuela), which your argument suggests is impossible, if they just “run maths over and over”.

In reality, US could get away with debt due to the special status USD enjoys in international trade, which neither Zimbabwe, Venezuela, or China could.

&gt;The Chinese also have a vast empire of colonies they bought, with a huge flow of natural resources towards their economic hubs. Their industry is too big to fail, even with a smaller workforce. Automation works miracles if you look at mid and long term.

Problem is, automation works elsewhere as well. With more automation, China completely loses its comparative advantage which supported its economic growth from 1990 to 2010: cheap labor for labor intensive factories (as the surplus of population, earlier locked in rural areas during the Cultural Revolution, was released into cities for productive activities). With automation, work could move to Vietnam, other Asian countries, or the US, as the migration of factories from China started a few years back.

This does not solve Chinese *unemployment*. When US gets widespread unemployment, they may change President, [when China gets widespread unemployment…](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-jobs-rebound-doesnt-appear-as-robust-as-the-government-claims-11591551390) Hint: there is a reason that [Li Keqiang suggested the return of hawker economy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/12/chinas-lifeblood-street-hawkers-make-surprise-return-to-fire-up-ailing-economy), because the employment picture is really bad.

&gt;With those resources, their military is growing, and so is their number of allies.

Anti-CCP sentiment is at all time high [according to… CCP](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-sentiment-ex/exclusive-internal-chinese-report-warns-beijing-faces-tiananmen-like-global-backlash-over-virus-idUSKBN22G19C), not to mention [the strong words from G7](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/06/g7-urges-china-impose-national-security-law-hong-kong-200618005544720.html) and [EU](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/3091105/eu-urged-speak-single-voice-against-chinas-national-security-law). I hope you are not counting [India or Brazil](https://newbloommag.net/2020/06/25/brazil-india-tw-china-tensions/) as Chinese ally.

&gt;The USA back HK from a distance, but dare not defend it for real. They have not stopped China from interfering in HK's politics.

This one is a bit complicated, partly because Trump had his own agenda a year ago. But suffice to say that now defending Hong Kong has bipartisan support.

&gt;Only their own demographics can endanger their position now, but I wouldn't be surprised if they already found a solution for that as well.

When people talk about the rise of China (referring to the growth between 1990 and 2010), they often overlook the fact that the rise is due to demographics: as mentioned above, the surplus of population for labor intensive industries supporting export (compound with trading with EU and US for market outlets). The slowdown of Chinese growth (ignoring non-productive activities such as ghost cities) is precisely the same reason of demographics: there is no more surplus of population locked up in rural areas waiting to be converted to workforce in cities. If they could solve the problem of demographics, there would have been no need to call for hawkers economy."

Birth rates in the mostly Uighur regions of Hotan and Kashgar plunged by more than 60% from 2015 to 2018, the latest year available in government statistics. Across the Xinjiang region, birth rates continue to plummet, falling nearly 24% last year alone — compared to just 4.2% nationwide, statistics show.

**Ugyhurs weren't affected by the one child policy** so now as the place modernizes birth rates will dramatically decrease as compared to the the Han Chinese which were affected by the policy and can't decrease anymore.

&gt;The state regularly subjects minority women to pregnancy checks, and forces intrauterine devices, sterilization and even abortion on hundreds of thousands, the interviews and data show. Even while the use of IUDs and sterilization has fallen nationwide, it is rising sharply in Xinjiang.

Again use of IUDs and sterilization has fallen nationwide because they were already low and therefore can't drop any lower.

TLDR:

minorities were exempt from one child policy and had many kids. Now they have to follow this law resulting in massive drops.

Han Chinese were already affected so since they had low birthrate they can't go even lower

The invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq were planned before 9/11. Several members of the Bush administration, who were members of PNAC, longed for a Pearl Harbour like event to get green light and funding for their world dominance project.

2020-06-29 21:23:56,GreatRolmops,"I largely agree with you. Cultural genocide may not be as bad as an actual genocide in the traditional sense, but it is still bad. Very bad. As you say, culture is an essential component of what makes a people. And what China is doing in Xinjiang and to a lesser extent in Tibet, definitely constitutes a crime against humanity in my opinion.

It is however important to keep in mind that the ultimate aim of the Chinese government here is not to destroy the Uyghurs and their culture, but rather to re-make it in the image of the CCP. If we (as in ""the West"") are to do anything to stop China from committing these atrocities, we first need to understand what China is really doing and why it is committing those atrocities in the first place. The kind of re-education camps that have sprung up in Xinjiang are nothing new in China, they were once common across the entire country in the decades after the civil war. The CCP has a long tradition of using such camps and atrocities to break what it views as enemies or ""undesirables"" and remold them into Chinese communist citizens. As the West, doing something about it will be difficult given how much the economical and military power of China has grown in recent years, but the understanding of Chinese actions and motives is critical. As Sun Tzu once said: before you go to fight your enemy, you must first seek to understand him. Only then can you be victorious.

2020-06-29 20:45:06,Pylyp23,"&gt; Genocide is normally aimed at removing a certain population. What China does is the opposite of that. It doesn't want to remove the Uyghurs, but rather it wants to (forcibly) incorporate them into the Chinese state and the multi-ethnic Chinese people.

Great post. My only response is that my disagreement with you is merely one of semantics. Unlike you I would say that what you refer to as ""cultural genocide"" and genocide are the same thing. ""Genocide is the intentional action to destroy a people—usually defined as an ethnic, national, racial, or religious group—in whole or in part."". It doesn't matter if people of the same DNA survive- it is still genocide when just the culture is destroyed. Ethnicity is as much culture as it is blood. The destruction of the culture is as much genocide as the destruction of the people who are a part of it. As for the Han being as subjected: while they are subject to the same laws they are not enforced at all in comparison to the Uighurs. While China's methods may not be as sickening as those genocides you use as an example since they are not outright murdering as many people they are still conducting a genocide against the Uighurs. 

As I said in the beginning though mine and your disagreement here is mainly one of semantics. My only qualm with your position is that it seems to be forgiving of China's methods which, even if they are not genocide, should constitute crimes against humanity.

I have to temper that though. It isn't just about handing out condoms. The hard part is getting people to use them. To willingly chose to have few children.

This can be very difficult, as it goes against the pre-existing traditions and way of life, and mentalities are not easily or rapidly changed.

To give you an example, *while we were having this very debate*, I have also been spending most of my time desperately trying to help an Indian colleague of mine.

She left India to do her Ph.D here, in Norway. And she's on a clear path to failing, because she is unable to focus on her research. 

Why?

Her family in India is absolutely harassing her with marriage. She ***needs*** to get married and have children, because if she does not, it's a ""dishonor"" on all of them.

For China, containing an aggressive Modi that is making moves such as visiting Mongolia and joining the quad is much more important.   


China knows that India will never accept a strong China. So, any business that China gets is a bonus. Its good to have not something to rely on. A weak and poor India that can't even buy Chinese products is probably better for them.   


China will invest and make money in India as much they can, but will take it as a bonus. But it will focus primarily on containing and weakening India. Breaking India into small pieces is probably even better.   


India have had protectionism in the past, and it kept them from growing fast. Hindu rate of growth is a term because of this reason.

Also all the actions that China has taken in the past month has hurt China more than India, because it turned public sentiment strongly against China. A whole generation of young Indians now harbor hate and distrust towards the Chinese that never existed on this scale before, and what will become the world's most populus country soon is a market that will shut Chinese businesses out now. Chinese are still investing money into India(look at Vivo sponsorship of IPL), but India is reducing consumption of Chinese products. This is GREAT for the Indian economy.  
  
Also the reason US isn't taking more strict action vs China is because the nation itself is going through a civil crisis on top of the pandemic, and the government is in a super insecure position right now with national elections coming up soon.

For China, keeping a hostile India that has 1.3 billion people down and weak and poor is much more important than losing marketshare on some apps. So, they made a calculated move to strike India while it is already down with Covid. This way, they got revenge for Doklam standoff. In the future, India will be much more careful about about making similar moves against China. They will also be forced to focus on their land border and therefore, not invest much on their navy. Again, giving China more space in the Indian ocean. India will also be forced shift its focus from attacking Pakistan, which is going through its own economic struggles, therefore, giving them more breathing space to develop. A strong Pakistan will automatically keep India contained. Which is what China wants, a contained and poor India.

India's goal should be to develop and get rich, they can't do that without Chinese products and Chinese investment. So, them banning China is an own goal. Even when US was hostile, China never stopped US investment and products. They knew how to swallow their pride for long-term goals.

Advances in bioengineering have helped repair severely damaged uteruses in rabbits through cellular tissue engineering, researchers said in a study published Monday.

The breakthrough, scientists believe, offers hope for partial reconstruction in women afflicted with so-called uterine factor infertility, which accounts for about six percent of all infertility cases.


Currently, the only way for a woman with this condition to give birth is with a transplanted uterus.

A team at Wake Forest University in North Carolina implanted biodegradable polymer scaffolds -- engineered tissue partially generated from one's own cells -- into damaged rabbit uteruses. 

Six months after implantation, the new tissue appeared no different than in non-damaged uterus, they reported in Nature Biotechnology. 

Furthermore, four in 10 rabbits that had received the cell-engineered tissue had normal births, while none of those who hadn't received the reparative treatment did. 

""Our results introduce new avenues for potentially creating tissue substitutes derived from a patient's own cells to treat uterine defects,"" the authors concluded. 

Tissue bioengineering offers an alternative to organ transplant, which is hampered by a lack of donors and requires the recipient to take immunosuppressive drugs. 


Similar bioengineering techniques have already been used for human bladders, blood vessels, urethras and vaginas. 

But human uteruses have yet to be restored using this technique, partially because of their complexity compared to other organs. 

Scientists not involved in the study noted that more animal experiments are needed before moving to human clinical trials. 

While bioengineered tissue for uterine replacement is an ""attractive and novel technology, it may not be as close to translation as the authors and many of us would like to see,"" said Dusko Ilic, a professor at King's College London. 

""The next experiment is not a partial replacement of the uterus but a total replacement of the uterus,"" said John Hunt, a professor at Nottingham Trent University in the UK. 

But the findings, reported in Nature Biotechnology, are an important first step, the authors said. 

""Larger animal models, where one can replace critical-size defects with engineered constructs, are important in highlighting potentially human clinically relevant regeneration,"" they said.

But they do have a weapon to stop demographic assimilation, that is terrorism. If they keep Kashmir destabilized and simmering, they might be able to prevent Indians from moving in. No one wants to move to a restive region.

Kashmir faces 1 or 2 centuries of continuous sacrifice and struggle for survival. But this is not the only time a minority region has faced such hardships. Greeks and other Balkan areas of Europe lived 300 years under Ottoman rule and still maintained their identity and finally got their own country. They had to face this kind of subjugation and many did assimilate and became indistinguishable from turks. But, enough remained to keep their identity alive.

In the distant future, if India gets weak and starts to break apart, that will be the opportunity for Kashmir to break free. Until then, they face hell."

\-Uncontrolled population growth until death rate catches up with birth rate again

\-Brutal population control as is the case in China.

But I believe we should go for a **different, good option**:

\-Gentler population control, *without* the Chinese brutality.

The only places where having ""as many kids as they want"" works are those where having few kids is already the social norm. This isn't the case for most of the world.

A change in those social norms is now rapidly needed in many places with currently galloping demography. Hence the need for some form of demographic control.

2020-06-29 17:49:40,GreatRolmops,"&gt; The difference here that you are completely missing is that they  practice those methods on criminal and socially unworthy Han Chinese  while they are doing it to every Uighur regardless of if they have  committed crimes instead. 

That is just completely false. Evey single Han Chinese in all of China is subject to the same birth control laws as the Uyghurs. Han Chinese who violate these policies are considered criminals and are subjected to sometimes extreme sanctions, including forced sterilization. The only exceptions are wealthy businesspeople and government officials, who often get off with a fine or no punishment at all. But that is more of a problem with corruption within the CCP than an ethnic issue.

Now, you are right in that Uyghurs (especially those that the CCP considers to be involved with separatism or Uyghur nationalism) are often treated more harshly than Han when it comes to crime, and are often send to camps for very slight violations or even no violations at all. This includes violations of birth control laws, which being a common ""crime"", have become a very convenient excuse for the government to arrest people and send them to ""re-education camps"". But this is part of China's wider campaign of forced assimilation against the Uyghurs, and not evidence of China trying to commit genocide on the Uyghurs through draconian birth control policies (which apply to the Han as well). If these birth control laws were aimed specifically at controlling the Uyghur population, then they wouldn't apply to every other ethnicity in China as well."

1. On the International arena, prioritizing their economic ties and strategic relationships with China, many governments have ignored the human rights abuses. In July 2019, after a group of mostly European countries—and no Muslim-majority countries—signed a letter to the UN human rights chief condemning China’s actions in Xinjiang, more than three dozen states, including Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, signed their own letter praising China’s “remarkable achievements” in human rights and its “counterterrorism” efforts in Xinjiang.

But it's good not to have rockets aimed at each other. That is merely a pipedream unfortunately. 

&gt; In this regard, the document also [confirms Putin’s earlier statements](https://vcdnp.org/russia-clarifies-its-nuclear-deterrence-policy/) about Moscow’s “launch under attack” posture, which considers the use of nuclear weapons based on **“reliable information”** of incoming missiles aimed at Russia or its allies. This stance, designed **to avert a potential U.S. first strike with either nuclear or conventional weaponry on Russia’s nuclear forces or supporting command-and-control architecture,** is unnerving given the well-publicized flaws in Russia’s strategic early warning system. However, **this declared posture may simply aim to discourage NATO from launching** any missiles near Russia, including those with non-nuclear or low-yield nuclear warheads, since **verifying if an incoming missile carries a large, small or non-nuclear payload is presently impossible.** 

(I provided the [link](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/28857/what-s-behind-the-new-russian-nuclear-weapons-strategy) in another comment as well.) Above quote mentions 'allies' that can mean Iran, Syria... That means Russia will not give up its geopolitical game.

Explaining the motivations of a deed is not the same as approving of it. I understand where palestinian hate comes frim, doesnt mean i excuse attacks on civilians.

&gt;No, I literally debunked that. I literally told you that both Jews and Arabs were still living there. The land was controlled first by Turkey, not the Arabs. Jews had still been living there when Britain got the land and more were going there since the end of the Holocaust. Again, where did I get angry? How is me pointing out historical reality ""getting angry""? Stop gaslighting. The Palestinians lost the land by attacking Israel, they don't now get to whine about it. I'm sorry but no, if you lose, you don't get to resettle on that land. This is true for every country (Britain, America, Germany, Austria, Russia, etc.). It has never been a thing for refugees to go back and settle where they were displaced. No country has ever been obligated to do so except Israel. 

Except war was launched by surrounding arab countries. Palestinians had no unified military group nor unified political command to claim that they participated in a war as any sort of united entity. Other than that i agree, as i am against returning golan to syria. 

&gt;Dude, even if they ""didn't have enough"" to destroy the state, that was their intended goal. They weren't going to war for shits and giggles. Being unprepared for war does not suddenly mean it was not your goal. Napoleon and Hitler wanted to take over Russia but were unprepared for it. Does that suddenly mean they weren't attempting to? ""Everything"" no, it literally means nothing. Like be intellectually honest. 

My point was more that israel was not really under threat of extinction as you claimed. They invaded to do exactly what they did eventually - to grab some land for themselves. May be less than what they expected, but still.

&gt;Yes, when we say ""The Germans were Nazis"" we are not trying to say that ""all Germans are Nazis"".

Even if you don't - there are people who think that way. That is why i try not to say it like that. I mean, you have asian people in usa harrased for actions of china exactly because of people taking it too literally.

&gt;Violating what peace plan? The peace plans that the Arabs and Palestinians routinely reject and spit upon when they attack Israel? Like give me a break, how is it a ""violation"" when Israel retaliates when Hamas fires rockets at them or pledges to kill Jews? You do realize that not everyone thinks the same as their prior leader, right? If a radical terror group takes control, you don't have to continue working with them. That's like saying the US had to help Revolutionary France despite how batshit insane they were because we were allies before (even though they chopped off the head of the guy we made the treaty with). Institutions change, so why treat them with the same level of credence?

I want my country to be better. I want my politicians to be held accountable. I want my country to admit wrongdoings (not german guilt-shaming level) and make wrongs right. Both palestinians and jews suffered, so those affected must get some reparations and move on. Their pain must be acknowledged. Those who get reparations and continue bitching can go F themselves. Sorry if i dont consider this ""hate boner""

&gt;How is it ""the gift that keeps on giving"". What dumb logic? The logic that Jews were there still in Palestine and not removed as you proclaimed? How is me informing you that is not the case ""losing my shit""? You didn't debunk anything. 

Logic you presented is ""if you lost you have no claim to the land"" which is nonsense. I showed you how this logic applies to jews and you got angry. Even tho you missed the point of my comment - you had proper reaction to bullshit picture that was born from your logic.

&gt;What does army sizes and logistics have to do with this?

Everything. They simply didn't send enough troops to actually destroy newborn israel. Even if that was the goal they claimed to pursue. 

&gt;Guess if I said ""The Chinese are throwing people in concentration camps"" you would be up and at me because I said ""Chinese"" and somehow that might be """"generalizing"""".

In fact, i would.

&gt;""Punishment for Israel must be roughly the same"" for fucking what? Defending itself?

No, for violating the peace plan that it claimed it will go with. You wont achieve peace with agreement where one side can easily violate it without repercussions and other will be screwed for doing it. Even friends must be called out on their bullshit, otherwise it is not friendship.

&gt;Arafat was promising to work with Israel and to try and achieve peace. It wasn't perfect, especially from a former terrorist, but it was a start.

I'm afraid it wasn't even a start. Rabin was either naive as a toddler ot hungry for nobel peace prize. And beside the fact - israel was one who armed what is now PNA. Why we expect unarmed civilians to fight oppressive regime that we ourselves installed? It seems pretty unfair to me."

The difference here that you are completely missing is that they practice those methods on criminal and socially unworthy Han Chinese while they are doing it to every Uighur regardless of if they have committed crimes instead. You seem to not understand why they are different or choose to not differentiate these two things in order to push your agenda. Either way, whether you are wrong or truly malicious, your post is incorrect and the point you are trying to make is non-existent.  


The fact is that while sterilization is used nation wide as a punishment in Chinas  Justice System it is being used in this case as part of a coordinated genocide in the case of the Uighurs. They are putting them in concentration camps, killing those who offer to much physical or mental resistance, and then sterilizing and freeing those who they are able to break. The Chinese use sexual assault/rape, beatings, mental torture, and other methods in order to reach their goal of destroying the Uighur culture. This is textbook genocide."

That is the logical consequence of birth control measures being enforced now on the Uyghurs, whereas they had not been before. Uyghur birth rates were much higher than Han birth rates to start with, because Uyghurs were not subjected to the same restrictions and punishments as the Han. If China indeed applies the laws equally, as they claim to do, then we should see the fall in birth rate flatten out over the next few years and become similar to the Han birth rate."

2020-06-29 15:52:44,GreatRolmops,"Why do you think that Japan Times and Associated Press are somehow incapable of propaganda? China isn't the only country churning out loads of propaganda. In fact, given the animosity between China and Japan, Japanese media is especially prolific when it comes to propaganda.

China forces these severe birth control measures (including forced sterilization and detention) on everyone, both Han and Uyghurs. So while you could find China's birth control methods abhorrent (I know  I do), they don't seem to be designed to supress the Uyghur population specifically but rather the population in general. This article however claims that they do specifically target Uyghurs and connects it to other mistreatment of the Uyghurs at the hands of the Chinese government, but the article doesn't provide any evidence for that claim. From that, you can deduce that it is likely bogus (why not give the evidence if you have it?) aimed primarily at stirring anti-Chinese sentiment rather than factual reporting.

If you go to the AP article this based on, it isn't much better. They have statistics that are meant to prove their theory, but they don't give you much meaningful information. One of the statistics shows that birthrates are dropping faster and forced sterilizations are more frequent in minority areas than the national average, but this is logical because minorities weren't subjected to these measures until recently, whereas Han already were.

All of this is not to say that the CCP doesn't specifically target Uyghurs (I mean, given their other policies against Uyghurs, they probably do), it is just that these articles fail to give enough evidence to substantiate their claims and do a poor job of factual reporting. Just because everyone loves to bash China doesn't mean you should be printing claims without providing solid evidence."

2) Yes, in a world with finite resources, population cannot grow indefinitely. This is a simple mathematical truth. At some point, either birth rate goes down, or death rate goes up. ***This does not mean a ""one child policy"" is necessary***.

What does army sizes and logistics have to do with this? Like why does that matter? The Arabs weren't attacking Israel just to gain a few strips of land, it was literally a war to destroy a state that wasn't even a day old. What did you expect would happen if Israel lost?

""Palestinian"". Sorry, did I offend you? That is the group of people that are doing it, correct? Is it suddenly wrong to point that out? Guess if I said ""The Chinese are throwing people in concentration camps"" you would be up and at me because I said ""Chinese"" and somehow that might be """"generalizing"""". Give me a break. 

Alright then if that is true, fine. That sounds like a shitty thing.

We never pretended. Literally never. Israel was allied with the US, the Arabs with the Soviets. Then afterwards, Palestinians decided to resort to terror and the rest is history. It is in America's interests to stabilize the region on a geopolitical level since Israel is an ally of the United States and a valuable resource in the region. Like West Germany and South Korea, its literally in our interests to keep the peace. 

""Punishment for Israel must be roughly the same"" for fucking what? Defending itself? Last I checked, Israel wasn't committed to destroying an entire people. The Palestinians don't get to cry foul when Israel retaliates. Israel's list of shitty acts pales in comparison to the ones done by Palestinians. It being more powerful does not make it worse somehow. 

Arafat was promising to work with Israel and to try and achieve peace. It wasn't perfect, especially from a former terrorist, but it was a start. Now his successors are actively trying to destroy any hope of a two state solution. So as such, you should hope that the people overthrow that government. I'm sorry but thats how it works.

In order to defend itself, Russia must clear these targets in a short time. That guarantees Russia must make a very fast decision, not giving time to properly determine what is coming. But I'm also convinced NATO would not provoke Russia to the very limit that can be interpreted as a war because NATO does not have defence against any nuclear strike. Unfortunately, the first strikes need to be nuclear strike by default because of nuclear installations in Europe. It would not be a tease or a noisy catfight.

The area was split between Jews and Arabs, hence why the British tried dividing it, of which lead to the Arabs trying to beat up and kill any Arab they find (Peel Commission). Like wow, your historical ignorance is just something.

I merely used your dumb logic against you and you lost your shit. Gift that keeps on giving.

&gt;Like moron, it was a war of extermination.

Arab armies send 2 times more soldiers than what jews had. They were uneducated bunch with no discipline, while lots of jews were deserters from armies that participated in ww 1 and 2 and had pretty serious expirience. By any military standarts to take out enemy that sits in defence you must send ~4 times more soldiers (considering lack of tactics). They probably seriously underestimated jews, but extinction was not at the table. Palestinians actually are pretty angry at arab countries because they didnt try hard enough.

&gt;Well then that shows the evil of the Palestinians using mentally ill people to blow themselves up. Tell me again how Jews are comparable? How is this even an argument?

2020-06-29 15:04:15,pacman1993,"I don't know about that. I agree that there is a huge problem with the pension system, and it defenitely wasn't designed to support the amount of years people spend in retirement nowadays. That's why you see countries raising the retirement age to later and later in life (in Portugal, my country, its 66 years old). 

But automation is not a problem, or at least shouldn't be. Automation makes the job tasks more efficiently than humans, for a lower cost. This means they generate more wealth, and that is always good. The problem is that that wealth is not being distributed to the people who got their job posts automated via social assistance, because the owners of the automated job posts are hoarding that extra wealth being created. This is supposed to be a safety net until new jobs are naturally created, the kind of jobs that don't exist nowadays yet, just like nowadays there are jobs that didn't exist 40 years ago. So, I think the problem is that the 1% is getting richer and not sharing their wealth (read: not paying the amount of taxes they should be paying) and the rest are getting poorer and more unemployed.

Just my 2 cents, but I can also be wrong."

That will do jackshit. 

&gt;And the recent attention to China's misbehaviour, to put it lightly, does have consequences. Countries do in fact care about how they are perceived. Even authoritarian ones. Take Saudi-Arabia and Jamal Kashoggi, for instance, and before that their crackdown on women's rights.

It also helps to empower local activists to push back against their regimes when they see foreign states criticize their governments. So we shouldn't ignore this. 

There's a good book on this, The Power of Human Rights, by Risse, Ropp and Sikkink (as well as an updated and better version that accords more to power realities, The Persistent Power of Human Rights).

&gt;Trump’s proposal was a blatant acknowledgment that the Palestinians at this point should take it or leave it.

My only issue with trump's plan is that it is not equally punishing for israel and palestinians. Right now bibi opposes palestinian state, while voicing support for it in Washington. He only wants to take a juicy parts of plan and throw rest to garbage. And plan doesn't have any significant punishment for such bullshit. 

Also, abbas and hamas are hardly relevant representatives, considering that they had exactly one election like 10 years ago, slaughtering each other right afterwards. They also benefit greatly from current situation, so i am not surprised in a slightest that they refuse to do anything that may hurt their profits."

2020-06-29 13:23:22,Langernama,"#Merkel’s Dr. No gets his toughest mission yet
Chief Europe adviser will try get EU to say ‘yes’ to common debt.

_This article is part of a special report: [Berlin in Brussels](https://www.politico.eu/special-report/germany-special-report-angela-merkel-ursula-von-der-leyen-presidency-council-eu-european-commission/)._

Europe’s most powerful bureaucrat works from a sparsely furnished mid-sized office on the second floor of a building overlooking a train station — in Berlin.

Few outside the machine room of European politics are likely to have heard of Uwe Corsepius, but in the halls of Brussels and in capitals across the Continent, the mere mention of his name stirs a combination of fear, anger and admiration.

Corsepius, 59, has served as Angela Merkel’s chief adviser on Europe for most of her time as chancellor, helping to [guide her through](https://www.politico.eu/article/eurozone-problem-country-germany-coronavirus/) the EU’s never-ending crises. Thanks to that longevity (and his close proximity to Merkel), Corsepius has stitched together the most important network in Europe of anyone in the German government.

Despite his low profile (in keeping with the tradition of advisers to the chancellor, he avoids the public eye and rarely speaks to the press), Corsepius is widely considered by insiders to be more influential in European affairs than Germany’s own foreign minister.

In the months ahead, Corsepius will play a crucial role as Germany [takes over](https://www.politico.eu/article/angela-merkel-donald-trump-germany-europe-strong-again/) the EU’s rotating presidency, which falls in the middle of what Merkel [has called](https://www.politico.eu/article/angela-merkel-coronavirus-is-germany-biggest-postwar-challenge/) the “biggest challenge” in the bloc’s history.

A trained economist who grew up in West Berlin, Corsepius began his career in the economy ministry during the Helmut Kohl era, working for a time at the International Monetary Fund in Washington.

He was assigned to the chancellery when Kohl was still in office, but his professional breakthrough came when an analysis he wrote on EU finances caught the attention of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. Corsepius worked for Schröder’s chief EU adviser, taking over the position himself when Merkel became chancellor in 2005.

Most of Germany’s European specialists emerge from the foreign ministry, and Corsepius’ atypical start and background (he has a Ph.D. in business economics) earned him the suspicion of colleagues, some of whom question his commitment to Europe to this day.

""He's not a dyed in the wool European,"" said a longtime German EU official, describing Corsepius as a ""obstructionist.""

Corsepius, an ambitious tennis player in his younger days, played an important role in the early stages of the eurozone's debt crisis, batting away attempts by Athens and other capitals to convince Berlin to bear more of the burden of bailing out countries caught up in the crisis. Corsepius was also the driving force behind the ""[great big German nothingburger](https://www.economist.com/europe/2018/06/09/frances-plans-for-euro-zone-reform-get-a-lukewarm-german-response)"" response to the federalist fantasies put forth by French President Emmanuel Macron in his famous Sorbonne [speech](https://www.politico.eu/article/5-takeaways-from-macrons-big-speech-on-europes-future/) in 2017.

Yet for Merkel, herself a trained scientist who prizes analytical ability, the sober economist has proved an ideal fit. Officials who have witnessed the two in action over the years say Corsepius is more than your average sherpa. “He has Merkel’s complete confidence and trust,” one senior European diplomat said.

That’s one reason why Corsepius often draws the ire of colleagues in Brussels and national capitals. For them, he’s “Dr. No.” Whether the issue involves the minutiae of the EU budget or the expansion of the EU, Corsepius has a reputation for pouring cold water on Brussels’ often frothy agenda.

Corsepius, who left Merkel’s service in 2011 for a four-year term as secretary-general of the Council of the EU, has an ingrained skepticism of the Commission and attempts by officials there to bolster the executive’s power, his associates say. He often clashed, for example, with former Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker’s right-hand man, [Martin Selmayr](https://www.politico.eu/article/martin-selmayr-monster-of-the-berlaymont-or-committed-european/).

“Many in Brussels consider him to be too much of a nationalist,” one former colleague said.

In his dealings with European counterparts, Corsepius makes no secret of the fact that he pursues what’s best for Germany.

Even so, his supporters argue that while Corsepius might not wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to the EU, that doesn’t make him anti-Europe by any stretch. “Germany’s future rests on Europe’s success, and he understands that,” one said.

Indeed, for all the skepticism over his commitment to Europe, Corsepius played a central role in pushing through the Lisbon Treaty during Germany’s last presidency. More recently, he spearheaded Germany’s push, together with France, for a €500 billion debt-financed recovery fund to help countries struggling with the economic fallout of the pandemic.

During the German presidency, it will fall in large part to Corsepius to broker a compromise with skeptics of that plan, the so-called Frugal Four. The Netherlands, Denmark, Austria and Sweden object to structuring the aid as grants that don't have to be paid back, pushing loans instead.

Another priority will be to set the stage for an agreement on the EU’s seven-year budget, a goal that eluded the past several EU presidencies.

Merkel has also pledged to make headway on strategies for the twin forces upending European society and industry: climate change and digital technology.

The German presidency will also have to find a way forward with China. EU-China relations have been strained by indications that Beijing obscured the extent of the danger posed by COVID-19. Due to the pandemic, the EU postponed a planned summit with China set for September but Berlin has pledged to reschedule.

Despite concerns over human rights abuses in Hong Kong and elsewhere in the country, China remains a key trading partner, especially for Germany, which will make finding a common EU position a top priority.

Another challenge on Corsepius' desk during the German presidency will be Brexit. If EU negotiations with the U.K. over a trade deal don’t succeed by the end of the year, the bloc would face yet another economic shock.

Though Corsepius can be affable in private, he looks every bit the Prussian bureaucrat his detractors make him out to be. A tall, slender man with an austere demeanor, Corsepius speaks in measured tones with precise language and is not known to suffer fools.

That directness, which some call “in your face,” could come in handy in months ahead as Germany tries to keep Europe from crumbling. “Say what you will, at the end of the day, Merkel is lucky to have him,” one European diplomat said."

**The centrist Renew Europe political faction has added another EU leader to their roster after Ireland formed a new government over the weekend, with Fianna Fáil leader Mícheál Martin at the helm, tasked with overseeing the country’s economic recovery after the pandemic.**

[[Image](https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/06/w_56179463-800x450.jpg)] : ^(Ireland's Fianna Fail party leader Micheal Martin leaves the Convention Centre after being elected by the Irish Parliament as Taoiseach (the prime minister of the Republic of Ireland\) in Dublin, Ireland, 27 June 2020. [EPA-EFE/Aidan Crawley])

The centrist Renew Europe political faction has added another EU leader to their roster after Ireland formed a new government over the weekend, with Fianna Fáil leader Mícheál Martin at the helm, tasked with overseeing the country’s economic recovery after the pandemic.

The move brings 59-year-old Martin, a seasoned politician with more than thirty-five years of experience in politics, to the top of the pile in the new Irish government, which will be composed of Fianna Fáil, the EPP’s Fine Gael and the Green party.

On Saturday (27 June), a breakthrough was made as the three parties managed to broker a deal following months of deadlocked talks after an inconclusive national election in February.

The deal sidelines the leftist Sinn Féin outfit, who performed stronger than expected in the ballots earlier this year. 

Both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael had distanced themselves from the party in government talks, due to their group’s historic relationship to the Irish Republican Army.

“Our three parties come from very different traditions,” Martin said as part of his acceptance speech on Saturday.  

“We do not and could not be expected to agree on everything. However, we have been able to agree on core democratic principles and on a balanced and comprehensive programme,” he added, highlighting that forging Ireland’s economic recovery after the coronavirus fallout will be at the “very centre of everything the new government will do.”

Other pressing areas that the new government will seek to make headway in, include reducing waiting times for health appointments, increasing welfare support, and tackling the ‘existential crisis’ posed by climate change.

“Recovery and renewal. These are the themes which underpin everything in the programme for government which has been agreed between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party,” Martin said.

The new Irish prime minister brings a wealth of experience to the role, having previously served as a government minister across a number of portfolios including health, education, trade and foreign affairs. 

His earliest tenure in government was as part of Bertie Ahern’s first cabinet in 1997, where he became the youngest member of the administration at just 36 years old. In his role as education minister, he put forward a series of measures to increase spending across a range of educational initiatives and levels.    

Before that, Martin also served as a councillor for Cork city, as well Lord Mayor of Cork in 1992.  

In Brussels, the president of Fianna Fáil’s European political group, Renew Europe’s Dacian Cioloş, welcomed Martin’s appointment, saying that there are ‘challenging times ahead’ but that Martin could count on the support of his ‘European political family.’  

Prominent Renew MEP Guy Verhofstadt also added his voice to the chorus of applause at the news, saying he is confident Martin “will cement a strong Ireland at the heart of a United Europe.”

Meanwhile, outgoing EPP Taoiseach Leo Varadkar will take up a role as deputy prime minister, managing the enterprise, trade and employment portfolio.  

Varadkar said over the weekend that the new government formation was not necessarily a “day for celebration for Fine Gael,” but that the party is “doing what is right for the country.”

2020-06-29 04:36:51,ArbyntheChief117,"Literally everyone in human history has been displaced one place or another. It is not a thing under any circumstance that people who lost land now have a right to it anymore. That has never been a thing because if that were the case, all countries would cease to exist. So no, not legitimate, especially when they have been separated by several generations.

Its literally the truth, whether or not you want to accept it is up to you. Fun fact again pal, Arabs generally were not on the side of the Israelis. So yeah, they were displaced because what kind of army, in the middle of an ethnic and religious war, would allow people to stay behind their lines. Your lack of understanding of basic army tactics is astounding. Yes, under martial law, you generally do things that might seem like a dick move. And again, considering how it was a war of extermination by Arabs against Jews, why tf would they suddenly let people go back to land now occupied by Israelis unmolested? That’s like rule number one on what not to do for newly conquered land. And I’ll continue to say that Arabs are treated better in Israel, especially when you consider how shitty Jews are treated elsewhere. To also pull something from 70 years ago as an example of something today is something to behold and reveals your intellectual dishonesty yet again. 

Considering how Jews aren’t the ones doing that and that it is well documented that Palestinians do that, I would say that your use of “generalization” is a convenient shield to cloak very real problems with the Palestinians. And the fact you ignored my admission that not all Palestinians are like that is par for the course for you. 

Literally the Palestinians have been dealt better hands before for which they have refused every time. Trump’s proposal was a blatant acknowledgment that the Palestinians at this point should take it or leave it. They’ve tried before with more generous terms, you don’t get to whine when you are dealt a worse card. Israel is not going away anytime soon, so I would hope you understand that, especially as someone who lives there. Again, you ironically were the one crying foul about “generalizations” while you then generalize about Israelis. And ironically, everyone fucking condemns the Israelis. From the left in the US to the Europeans to the Russians. In the UN its called an average Tuesday, never acknowledging that the Palestinians and Arabs have a part to play and aren’t some victims. 

My mistake then. Read it wrong. 

Again, I read that wrong. But at this point, I would not be surprised if you did, given your rhetoric and blatant historical revision to cover for the Palestinians. Israel is sometimes guilty but the Palestinians are a heck of a lot worse offenders."

I wont disregard legitimate grievances of any of those displaced people.

&gt;And fun fact, when they were driving them out, they told them that those villages were under Arab control, that there was fighting coming so they should get out of the way. After the war was over, they could come back home. And you know what happened? Those that came back, integrated into Israeli society and were granted more rights and privileges than they ever would from the Arabs. 

What a load of crap. Fun fact - not all palestinians ran as far as to another country. Example - Acre (coastal city in northern israel). In 1948 city was taken pretty much without a fight (because defenders had their inner disputes), yet 3/4 of arabs were expelled. Most of them ran to nearby villages that were on a future israel territory (shefaram and so on). After war was over, israel refused to let them back to their properties under martial law. Google ""present absentee"". And remember it next time when you have an urge to babble about fair treatment of arabs in israel.

&gt;That the Palestinians literally teach their children to hate Jews and strap bombs to their chests?

And you get offended when i say that you generalise? Amazing.

&gt;But sounds like you are trying to attribute the whole what only applies to some.

I hear the settlement movement leader trashing trump's plan and saying that what it gives is ""nessesary but not nearly enough"" and instead of calling that bitch out other leaders nod in agreement. Ah right, we dont listen to words.

&gt;You talk of “propaganda” from the Israeli side yet you seem enthralled by the propaganda of people who name streets after terrorists, who send kites strapped with bombs into school grounds, whose stated goal is the eradication of your state.

I actually was talking about palestinian propoganda, but understanding context of a single sentence is too much to expect i guess.

&gt;And what’s funny too is that you have basically called Arabs who live freely in a tolerant democracy traitors.

Amusing indeed. Especially because i didnt say that. Wait, do you got ""cooperation"" as some negative word? Fucking hell..."

2020-06-28 22:19:20,rtechie1,"&gt;Who the fuck made you the arbiter of the hierarchy of experiments? Data is data.

I'm not the arbiter. The scientific method and hundreds of years of data are the arbiter. 

And those hundreds of years has taught us there is good data and bad data (look up N-rays). Not all data is equivalent as you claim. Subtle observations and surveys are lousy sources of data (again, N-rays). 

&gt;Sociology does not just make stuff up, it is based observation and statistical analysis.

Uncontrolled ""observation"" is opinion. 

I fly to Sweden and walk around observing that most people have blonde hair and blue eyes. Based on these uncontrolled observations, I conclude that most white people have blonde hair and blue eyes. Is that accurate? No. Because I didn't do proper sampling. You know, controls. 

&gt;Also, surveys and polls is how advertising and marketers collect data. That’s aren’t any huge labs with white walls where they isolate people and stick electrodes in their brains to get their response. They just ask people what they feel about a product.

Yes, which gives them exactly one point of data. How that person **SAYS THEY FEEL** about a particular product. Which is an opinion. Opinion surveys are very good at measuring **OPINION**, not facts in reality. 

A majority of Americans in polls say they believe angels are real. Does that make angels real? Of course not. Even if 99.99+% of respondents to a poll said angels were real, it's meaningless as to whether angels actually exist. 

&gt;&gt;	For example, objectification is literally just an opinion with no backing whatsoever. There is no evidence sexy women in media makes men treat women worse.
&gt;
&gt;“Sexy women exist in media” is not objectification, dumbass. It’s not only a part of gender studies but also media studies.

That's how it's treated by feminists. Read their media. Read Jezebel. Check out /r/mendrawingwomen. 

I also didn't insult you. But I don't mind. One needs patience with children. 

&gt;Objectification is when characters, in most cases female, are not ascribed agency within a piece of media and are treated somewhat like robots and only exist as either a love interest or a plot device. 

That's not how it's described by feminist scholars, but I'll go with it. 

Does a drama that focuses mostly on the home or personal lives of the women objectify the men who are peripheral love interests? I just watched the film 'Gone With the Wind' recently (my mother is obsessed with it) and the film is almost entirely about Scarlett O'Hara and her love life, with the only really significant non-romantic male character being an elderly doctor, and *he* was really just a plot device to generate hardship for Scarlett. The film is mainly a character study of Scarlett. 

My argument here is that media just works this way. ""Objectification"" is not sinister or wrong. 

&gt;This then affects the psyche of young men who consume this media (surely you’re not a complete imbecile who doesn’t think that media has any affect on people). 

The affect is trivial. Video games do not cause violence. 

&gt;r/NiceGuys is full of examples of guys who have been affected by this trope, these dudes believe that women are incapable of making choices for themselves and believe that if they input niceness into women, sex should pop out. That is what objectification is, not “sexy women exist”.

The guys over at /r/NiceGuys are wondering why women (generalizing, you can ignore that if you like) and media messages tell men they should be kind, respectful, etc. to attract women when consistently they see that doesn't work in their social circles. 

It's ironic, is case you can't figure that out. 

&gt;This just shows how ignorant you are. One day your thought-daddy came out and said “gender studies bad” and you were just like “yeah that feels right”. 

Unlike you, I've taken women's studies courses in college. 

&gt;You don’t know the first thing about science and data collection and interpretation.

2020-06-28 21:45:43,rtechie1,"&gt;What does them being popularised recently mean?

&gt;Computer studies isn't that old of a subject.

It's not. Which is why computer scientists don't claim any authority derives from antiquity or experience. 

&gt;History maybe an old subject but the periods it can study aren't limited to only the time after it was made.

I understand what you're saying here, but I'm not saying gender studies can't study the past. What I'm saying is they're taking a novel approach. 

&gt;What does being relatively new mean to you?

Modern women's / gender studies was developed in the 1970s with antecedents in the 1950s. Modern gender studies is not the same thing as historical feminism. Historical feminism is based on pragmatism, modern gender studies are based on deconstruction."

I think that the situation is not as simple, though. Moving countries involves a lot of spending and risks for those who choose to leave. Naturally, many would prefer staying, especially considering they and their families lived on the land for possibly generations. But now they have to associate themselves with a state they might not feel any sense of association with? Why would the russians in Ukraine want to be patriotic for the country when in recent years that very country has become increasingly unwelcoming? Russian is no longer a second official language, and efforts are made to focus on Ukraine as being a primarily Ukrainian ethnic state. 

On the other hand, yes, they've been invited to live in Russia instead. If they do that, there is no coming back - they would be shunned if they did for being traitors. In Russia, however, it is impossible to tell how welcome they would actually feel, how easy it would be for them to fit in the new place or find new occupation or housing. Population exchange, by the way, is a form of ethnic cleansing - we have a sort of still fresh example in Treaty of Lausanne (unless I butchered the name, its the one that ended the greco-turkish war like a hundred years ago). Basically, all greek turks were forced to move to Turkey, and all turkish greeks - to Greece. Sounds like a good and proper thing, yes? The issue is that a lot of those who moved over did not manage to fit at their new place, so the treaty caused unnecessary suffering and is generally considered by historians to be the first alarm bell for what kind of ethnic policy is considered acceptable within the next few decades.

Nothing is ever simple I think, and in the political situation in post-soviet Ukraine the only losing player is always the common person. And that sucks imo."

&gt; NEW DELHI - India is seeking the extradition of a top Pakistan militant suspected to have planned the 2008 Mumbai attacks after the United States said last week he was living freely in Pakistan, government officials said on Sunday.

&gt; One of them was Sajid, the &amp;quot;Project manager&amp;quot; of the Mumbai attack, believed to remain free in Pakistan, the U.S. report said.

&gt; An Indian official said the government has repeatedly asked Pakistan to hand over Sajid who is charged with serving as chief planner of the attacks, directing preparations and reconnaissance and was also named as one of the Pakistan-based controllers during the attacks.

If that is how you think of human beings, then you need to ask yourself when you started dehumanizing your fellow man.

Whatever Nasser intended to do in the 60s has no bearing on what Israel is doing in 2020.

There is no existential threats to Israel left. 

Lebanon is fractured politically and socially and militarily. 

Syria is impoverished and engulfed in a decade long civil war.

Egypt is under American influence and bound by treaty and practical necessity to keep the peace with Israel.

Jordan wouldn't be threat even if they were hostile, and they want as little to do with a war as the Egyptians do.

Iraq is lucky to even exist as a unified country at this point. 

Saudi Arabia is an unofficial ally. Mossad and Saudi Intelligence are in regular communication and Israel has deep economic ties to the Saudis.

Everywhere around you, there are weak states and tepid allies. You're not under siege.

And no amount of threat to you justifies any victor's justice to a defeated people.

I was using it to show that they're not some oppressed group forced into poverty (and the same goes for ""Jews in the US and Europe""). Studies show that 30-60% of Palestinians are obese. 

Israel’s checkpoints allow 100,000 Muslims living in the West Bank to voluntarily commute to Israel, and its border with Gaza is no more secure than Egypt’s.

2020-06-28 18:14:23,ArbyntheChief117,"Israel also was fighting a fucking war for its very existence. Like holy shit, forcing people to leave their homes happens all the time in war. Should Belgium bitch about Germans driving them from their home back in WW1 and WW2? Should the Austrians and Prussians whine about when they were forced from their homes by Napoleon? If you suspect that people within a village are supporting the opposing side, you don’t just sit on your ass and do nothing about it. 

And fun fact, when they were driving them out, they told them that those villages were under Arab control, that there was fighting coming so they should get out of the way. After the war was over, they could come back home. And you know what happened? Those that came back, integrated into Israeli society and were granted more rights and privileges than they ever would from the Arabs. 

Why do I have to take your word? If you even say you are Israeli, no shit you would serve in the IDF. That suddenly does not lend credence to your viewpoint. And yes, sometimes there are Jewish radicals. No one disputes that. Sometimes, constant warfare makes people hateful and radical. But sounds like you are trying to attribute the whole what only applies to some. Which is ironic considering how you just accused me of generalizing. Some people are dicks, that suddenly doesn’t mean you get to claim everyone else shares the same viewpoint. By your 

“Its racist” oh give me a fucking break. You have got to be kidding me. How is it racist to point out that Arabs and Muslims in Israel are living better than anywhere else in the Middle East? That the Palestinians literally teach their children to hate Jews and strap bombs to their chests? You talk of “propaganda” from the Israeli side yet you seem enthralled by the propaganda of people who name streets after terrorists, who send kites strapped with bombs into school grounds, whose stated goal is the eradication of your state. Israel could just end it in less than a day and yet they don’t. Why is that? They have the power. Maybe its because outside of a few radicals, Israel just wants to be left alone. You think the feelings would be the same on the other side if they had the power? 

I did not say that ALL Palestinians and Arabs are “inherently radical”. Again with your intellectual dishonesty. I guarantee, especially with all the unrest within Gaza against Hamas, that not everyone wants to cut up a Jew into pieces. Hell, the very fact I have mentioned that there are Muslims living within Israel that don’t share that sentiment proves that this is not the case. However, a LOT of Palestinians hate Jews to the point that opening up borders would be the death of many people. There are literally places where if you are a Jew, you will be pulled out of your car and killed. The reverse is broadly not true. 

Its wrong for people to attribute to Muslims the actions of a few Islamist extremists. Yet you somehow excuse the Palestinians for thinking similar things towards Jews and grant excuses to them, which is funny in that they were the ones that started this conflict. The Jews aren’t the ones discriminating against Muslims in their country, while in Palestinian land Jews are pretty much nonexistent. And what’s funny too is that you have basically called Arabs who live freely in a tolerant democracy traitors. Amusing. 

Israel accepted the original 1948 deal, they even accepted deals before that which were a lot worse to them. The Arabs and Palestinians never have."

1.) The atrocities from the Israeli side definitively seem to outweigh those of the Palestinian side in recent history.

2.) One side is a bunch of oppressed people without their own nation state, while the other IS A FREAKING NATION STATE WITH A PROFESSIONAL MILITARY. The latter even is considered an ally to various western countries and engages in trading regarding military equipment with those. It is just completely idiotic to argue as if both sides were on an equal footing here. The Israelis definitively need to be held to a higher standard, than a fucking terrorist group.

1.) The incendiary balloons launched from the Gaza strip are agro-terrorism. They target farm land, not people. There have been a few such balloons that landed on school property, but NO ONE WAS HARMED due to them. (And before you start an ill-faith argument: I am not defending this terrorism either. It's qualitatively different from the IDF openly firing at protestors or shelling and using air strikes against the Gaza strip, than a terrorist organization launching terrorist attacks though.)

2.) There have been Israeli children who died due to suicide bombings. However, from 2000 to today, for every one Israeli child that died due to such terrorist attacks, 15.8 Palestinian children have been killed.

&gt;Show me examples or rules of this discrimination. You keep saying it but I’ve yet to see it 

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism\_in\_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_Israel) 

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel\_and\_the\_apartheid\_analogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_and_the_apartheid_analogy) 

I could easily find way more links (and you could too with just a little bit of googling), but I doubt that you will even read these two articles in order to keep your own biased worldview alive, so those should be enough.

&gt;Ah yes defending yourself from extinction is literally creating terrorists. 

How is firing at peaceful demonstrations ""defending yourself from extinction""?! How is shelling and flying air strikes against the Gaza strip ""defending yourself from extinction""?! How is the settlement practice that violates international law ""defending yourself from extinction""?!

And yes, actions like these create terrorists, much like the horrific and shitty actions of the US military around the world and in particular in the Near and Middle East also created terrorists. Or how the actions of the British in Ireland also created terrorists there. And there are far more examples like this throughout history.

&gt;Israel has 2 million Arabs. Other middle Eastern countries have next to zero Israelis. 

""Other countries don't have any Jewish population and this means that those other countries must be evil!"" and ""Israel has an Arab minority, therefore they can't be the problem"" are just hillariously idiotic arguments, especially considering that those other countries don't have their Jewish minorities anymore due to the exodusses from 1948 to 1980 and that the Arab minority gets discriminated against.

Saying ""other countries appear to be bad"" also isn't an argument as to why one shouldn't criticize one specific country for being bad. (Especially if this country is considered a western ally and receives military equipment and other support from the western world.)

&gt;Once hamas stops sending missiles over Israel, Israel won’t have a reason to return fire 

Hamas is a terrorist organization that is attacking a nation state, even though they obviously, due to their terrorist nature, attack civilians when fighting against said nation state. Israel is a nation state that attacks a civilian population with its professional military. THERE IS A FUCKING DIFFERENCE HERE!

&amp;#x200B;

Seriously... You are filled to the brim with propagandistic bullshit and have such an undifferentiated and one-sided view of this conflict that it's not even laughable anymore. It's just fucking sad. Why do you think the UN and all the various Human Rights organizations have been criticizing Israel for years now?!"
2020-06-28 17:03:25,varlimont,"Okay, i feel like something needs to be made clear. Palestinians have zero reasons to like israelis. Israel drove thousands of them (including unrelated civilians) out pre and during 1948 war. Israel raised entire villages to the ground because they could be used by invading arab armies as a defence point (do you think all arabs in those villages were guilty of aomething?). Right now only israelis most palestinians interact with are settlers. Now you will have to take my word as i served in combat unit in IDF and was stationed in Hebron's jewish quarter. Settlers, even when they have legitimate claim on land liken onces in hebron, are incredibly radical and see arabs pretty much as animals. They were ordering pizza for my squad every time some palestinian was shot at checkpoint (it is messed up even if palestinian was attacking soldiers). If that would be the face of jews for me you better be sure i would be antisemitic myself. So you should not be surprised by general sentiment on palestinian street. On the other hand, arabs who live in israel, interact with jews and were not exposed to same levels of propoganda are way more cooperative. So saying that arabs or palestinians are inherently radical is just wrong and kind of racist."

The difference is pretty clear with a people that were born and raised as British citizens being mistreated to the point they no longer felt like they were British anymore. Compare that to a people that have never wanted to coexist with the Jews. Also the colonists never committed acts of terror against British citizens, only the government. The Palestinians actively target civilians. You are comparing apples to oranges. And consider how annexation would provide Israelis with more security, rather than having to duck and cover every so often when the Palestinians fire rockets at them. 

Ironically seems like you are making a generalization as well. 

Considering how they have said that for 70 years, with evidence to back it up (actions), I would say that I more inclined to believe them than a man who may not be PM soon.

Considering how the Palestinians have thrown away every peace offer and continued to target Israelis and Jews, especially by electing a terror group as their form of government, I would say that’s its understandable to not exactly treat Palestinian people who hate Israelis as citizens of Israel.

2020-06-28 13:13:39,akiseXyukki,"(The following is my conclusion based on the data I know. So, if you see that my data/conclusion is erroneous, do correct me please)

While genocide is a bad word to describe the situation, it is just as bad to claim that the rockets shot were pure self-defense either. 
  For decades Israel has been taking land that was assigned to the palestine population and establishing so-called 'illegal settlements', effectively annexing part of palestine every year (if you want to describe it in the most direct way).

  Meanwhile state news describe all palestinians blatantly as dangerous, terrorists, which they are not. On the palestine side however, if you go and actually visit them(which is hardly dangerous. Not like what's said in the media); the overwhelming majority of them is very kind and they're just a normal group of people. 
  But, another thing that has to be said is that they're terrified of Israel. Every year there are instances, where unarmed people, even small children with toy-weapons at times, are killed by the israeli police. While imo this situation is kind of reminiscent of the racial unrest we see in the US, it is far more excessive in Israel-Palestine. Many of the rocket attacks are usually responses to such massive killings. And who in their right mind would think that the right thing after being attacked by a terrorist group would be to just bomb the area where the rockets came from? Especially if there are civilians there? 
 The crimes done by Hamas are unquestionably heinous and must not go unpardoned, but they don't warrant excessive force against civilians, which sadly has been happening for years now.
 I do not know what the best course of action is. But the current situation cannot continue either. We have to stop the current policies of an 'eye for an eye' and try to find suitable compromises.

&gt; It’s not about how hard or how draconian : I guess their policies just don’t relate to your political agenda. You might accept heavy restrictions on drug use if they align with your moral compass

It exactly about how hard or how draconian. No agenda worth having justifies that. And I dont care what drugs you do either.

&gt; No talk about nuclear : No shit, France is basically running on nuclear. Why would we talk about something that is already producing 90% of our energy

Because you want to solve miniscule problem of 10% with only known working solution. Or you want to make populist promisses to get into power and then do whatever.

Yes. Thats the problem. More of it is not a solution.

No, you haven't. And they are on streets nonstop for like a year. And im not seeing Macaron or Merkel standing down cos of that.

And while nobody believes Yousuf Youhana just voluntarily converted, I'll give a pass because he did convert by his own accord, pressurised or not. But you just ignore the fact that Kaneria was outed from the team for being Hindu? Sounds very predictible of Pakistanis.  
  
The real genocide that happened in Kashmir was that of Kashmiri Pandits, and we're simply restoring their ancestral homeland while getting all Kashmiris to live in peace, away from Pakistan and their radical brainwashing.  
  
India has an internationally recognised claim, because USA supports India's claims on Kashmir, and that's all that matters, no one listens to a country that funds, arms and supports terrorists, and sends them to kill Indians, Afghans, Balochis, and even Americans(judging by 9/11). Pakistan hasn't won the war on terrorism, they've been consumed by it(became the very thing they swore to destroy lmao). Your government doesn't even function properly, your PM came into power through a rigged election, and the nation's power is consolidated into the hands of the military(I didn't even say that, a Pakistani friend told this to me).

We have Christian and Hindu judges in the Supreme Court. We've had Christian Cheifs of Army Staff. And Muhammad Yousaf was not pressurised to change his religion. He did it voluntarily and he is a devout Muslim. And, as I said we have problems but we'll figure them out by working with the leaders if those communities.

India doesn't have an internationally recognised claim in Kashmir. Kashmir is, according to UN's resolutions, a disputed territory. Pakistani Kashmiris are happy because they aren't being murdered or raped by the army. Their houses aren't being demolished. Their state hasn't been in a state of curfew for almost an year. Which is more than the inhabitants of IoK can say. If you really believe that Article 370 was repealed because Indian government wants economic growth in Kashmir, my friend, there is no hope for you.

Nobody takes a Pakistani's criticism seriously? So I guess we shouldn't care about Indians opinions until you guys stop murdering Muslims for eating cow meat and raping little Muslim girls and then **SEARCHING THEIR NAME ON FUCKING PORNHUB, YOU SICK ASSHOLES**.

All the articles I read about murder, rape(even of children) and forced conversions of Hindus tells me otherwise.  
  
There is no such thing as IoK, because India has an internationally recognised claim on all of Kashmir. They are happy only because Pakistan have left Kashmiris umeducated and brainwashed with radical Islamic propaganda, helped in no part thanks to the idiotic government India had before BJP. But the tide is going to change now, with economic growth of Kashmir, thanks to Article 370 being scrapped.  
  
Regarding Khalistan that's just pure bullshit, no Indian Sikh supports that rubbish, it's just Pakistanis and leftist Canadian idiots. The only Khalistan that will ever exist will probably be in Canada, and no one's stopping Sikh people from forming one there if they like.  
  
There's nothing going on in NorthEast India aside from China supported insurgencies which are dying out, again no NE Indian wants to leave India, or cecede just to be invaded by the Chinazis.

You can criticize a tax without bringing up someone's dead husband. People need to be able to listen to each other without feeling attacked all the time. There's this culture of ad hominem attacks and personal insults in our politics which redirect attention from the real issue. This makes it very hard to keep politicians accountable. Instead of focusing on the legitimate concern of the tax, the comment is all about a dead guy who is completely irrelevant to the conversation.

Israel has 2 million Arabs. Other middle Eastern countries have next to zero Israelis. Israel isn’t the problem. Once hamas stops sending missiles over Israel, Israel won’t have a reason to return fire"
2020-06-28 06:28:51,NullBrowbeat,"&gt;Except jews aren’t systematically killing an entire group of people. They’re just trying not to be murdered by all of their neighbors.

Israel occasionally likes to do air strikes over and shell the Gaza strip and uses excessive lethal force against demonstrations for Palestinian rights, which regularly results in dead civilians, even children, which didn't pose any imminent threat. They also enforce an illegal blockade on the Gaza strip. That is far more than ""just trying not to be murdered"".

&gt;Human rights ? They’re the only country in the Middle East that offers women and LGBT rights. Ehtnostate ? They have millions of Arab peacefully living with them.  

Oh wow! They have liberal LGBT rights! That certainly excuses the fact that, next to the already mentioned treatment of Palestinians where I could've brought forth even more points, they institutionally discriminate against the Arab Israeli citizens you mention, Ethiopian Israelis and treat refugees like shit.

&gt;How many other middle eastern countries are a home for jews ?? 

And in how far does the lack of Jewish minorities in middle eastern countries, which only even is the case since the mass exoduses between 1948 and 1980, excuse that Israel can treat their minorities like shit and discriminate against them? Or make life hell for Palestinians and thus even helping in the creation of new terrorists?

&gt;Israel is literally the home of jews. It is the only state in earth for the Jewish people 

And I generally support that fact. Much like I also think there should be a state for Kurdish people, Palestinians, Uyghurs and Tibetans. Maybe even for indigenous Americans aswell. It's one thing to allow certain ethnic groups to have their own state because they historically got oppressed and/or slaughtered by the nation states they are/have been minorities in. It's another thing to deny people their human rights and even treat ones own citizens as people of second class due to their ethnicity, like Israel is doing."

Oh lord.

For the most egregious example, Israel allows the right of return to all ethnic Jews regardless of origin, but denies displaced Palestinians native to the area the same right.

Japan still accepted those immigrants, who most certainly go against the dominant xenophobic trend in the country. Regardless, accepting those immigrants didn't magically make Japan better, or excuse any of its bad actions.

Israel interferes massively with the operation of the Palestinian economy and at one point literally cut it off from all funding that wasn't foreign aid. To say nothing of the settlements, or murders and displacement of palestinians.

I don't care for genocide olympics. What matters is that Israel is being terrible to the Palestinians now, and has them by the balls.

 Israel and the United States don't really care about LGBT people, else they wouldn't be aligned with Jordan and Saudi Arabia. It's largely incidental, and due to their high development.

Yes Israel is effectively an Ashkenazi ethnostate, there is discrimination against Beta Israelis and Shephardi even.

Japan had almost 200 thousand immigrants, but Japan is still a Japanese ethnostate.

They are oppressing Palestinians, primarily through their actions against the current Palestinian authority, but also in Israel itself.

What you've done here, this equating of Israel with the Jewish people in general, is also quite dangerous and stupid. It's exactly the method that Israel uses to guard itself from any criticism against its actions aswell, by claiming anyone who is criticizing Israels actions as a nation state is an antisemite."

There a lot of comparisons that can be made to how colonial powers in the 17th and 18th century related to situations such as the fall of the moguls in India and the power struggle in Egypt that resulted in Britian controlling both countries.

China's expended a great deal of effort to intimidate the local region; it may all just be a paper tiger, but it's an awfully expensive one.

I'm also curious what you define as another nation, as national identity is a historically new concept and even newer in the case of the Palestinians, who only really united under post 1948 pressures and then later further entrenched their nation identity under the Rabin era government. In addition there are very clear distinctions between the Arab Palestinians of Gaza and the Arab Palestinians of the west Bank who live under two different governments who have different relationships with the isreali government. Essentially my question for you is what is the another nation you refence to be present in 1948.

Chinese dissent is mostly pacified by the ""Dirt floors to drive-thru's"" massive economic growth they've experienced with the promise for more to come, but huge populations still live in poverty.

I think the only reason they haven't already made an overt and announced increase in their circle of influence is because 1)  the technological and infrastructural advantages of the US you pointed out and 2) they could rely on buying out key individuals and groups to slowly insinuate into the West to learn their secrets, copy their tech, and slowly demoralize them to the point that they wouldn't even think to strike against China.

They were relying on that to stay safe on the current path, but Trump and other anti-globalist leaders put a wrench in the works, so now China can't afford to be subtle.  Maybe the leadership's arrogant or deluded enough to think their manpower advantage and what they've managed to copy from their spies is enough, or maybe it's just sabre rattling meant to stoke fear."

You don't have to know about chromosomes to be able to differentiate between men and women. Of course these notions are defined by their ideal form, same as we would still call a non-perfect circle from real life a circle (which we imagine geometrically perfect). A man that is infertile is still a man, because if his body were in a non-defective state, he would be able to fulfill the male part of reproduction. Intersex people are not a group that *logically* follows from human reproduction (part of our life form), but a deviation. (1) The reproductive organs (visible or not) decide the sex (e.g. a phenotypical woman with inner testes but no womb/ovaries, is a defective man). (2) If somebody lacks them altogether, you can try to decide by chromosomes in general. If there's a Y it's a defective man, otherwise a defective women. (3) If somebody has both working organs, we can really speak of an intersex person in the narrower sense - one could call it neither male nor female, or both male and female.


To say that there is nothing wrong with 1 or 2, is like saying people who can't see stereoscopically don't lack a thing. You don't necessarily notice that you can't see stereoscopically, same as you don't necessarily notice inner testes or a lack of ovaries. Notice it or not, it's a defect - you deviate from the inner standard of the life form called human.

- Building « large projects » well we already canceled an airport because the local population just didn’t want it so it wouldn’t be so hard to implement.
- For restriction on advertisement, well depending on how much is restricted, most of the population would agree (stop glorifying cars, pollution ect), we already do it for pharmaceuticals and advertisements for children.
- On energy production it’s a continuation of the French Government trying to turn toward green energy (already pushing it with electric cars even though I admit it’s not working currently).

I can keep using the same argument, if it was that crazy the Green Party would not be gaining in popularity. And as I said, with these restrictions come incentives to ease the transition. Even the craziest ones (which is your opinion) are acceptable in Europe. The government can ban diesel vehicle in major cities because they all have an efficient public transport system which are still improving(and it doesn’t ban all diesel vehicles, companies can still use them).

Obama administration supported both sides and that didn't work out well. Trump sells weapons to the Saudis and propagandises Iran as the enemy, for better or worse.

There was a chance Iran and Saudi Arabia would be starved for cash, because of the oil crisis, but that's been averted by a deal with Russia, that US pushed.

The only fiasco I can see is the recent Gilets Jaunes crisis, an increase on oil prices made by our current president, often considered as a right politician. Recently, the government reduced the maximum highway speed but it also reduced the prices of public transport tickets.

2020-06-27 18:36:07,Mishiek_bh,"If you take the current political climate into the equation it would make sense for the US to keep up its military spending in case a situation causes an acceleration of foreign aggression for example Russia annexing Crimea back in 2014 (correct me if I got the wrong date) or Chinese maritime borders expanding via proxy islands being built on Philippine waters. I don’t agree with the fact that soldiers are being sent into proxy wars with Middle Eastern nations such as Iraq or placing sanctions on Venezuela but you need to take into account that those people joined the military knowing that they’ll be sent into foreign territory. Afghanistan is a special case because if the US doesn’t keep its troops in the nation to at the very least prop up the democratic government in the nation then the country will just be stuck in further political discourse but owned by Al Qaeda. I don’t know if you forgot but the US had to also send in troops to prop up Assad against ISIS since they were about to take over both Syria and Iraq. Moments like these is when we need the military to take out the radicals who want to disturb peace and democracy; not that Syria has democracy in the first place. 

To conclude the US needs the military to look strong and therefore stop imperialistic nations from doing anything bad. I hope you understand my point if you read it. :)"

2020-06-27 17:53:40,Shorzey,"&gt;Tell me again why is the armed forces so damn important? 

Youre not going to like why. We are Europe's and south east Asia's armies/navy too. We are their defense. Our forces in other European countries rival the host nations forces 9/10 times. We get to perpetuate imperialistic views on the world, while fueling a military complex that funds a healthy chunk of our economy, and has made those host nations completely and utterly dependent on us, while simultaneously allowing them to spend less on their defense budgets too.

&gt;Explain to me why is the USA bombing 7 nations constantly.

7? Oh you sweet summer child

&gt;Explain to me WHY are still in Iraq and Afghanistan? 

Because of politics. Democrats don't want us in the middle east any more, but Obama plunged a half dozen middle eastern countries into civil war by intervening in their politics and waging the largest remote bombing campaign ever, but then complain when we leave our allies we made like what happened with the Kurds, then, the Republicans do the exact opposite, and oppose the wars the democrats want, while being proponents and starters of wars like Iraq and Afghanistan

&gt;Why are we in Yemen and murdering innocent people all over the world.

Alot of it stems from the existence of really fucking bad people who actually do want to harm the US and US interests.

There are troops in every country. They wont nearly always be conventional troops, but there are SF and SOF groups in I kid you not, literally every single country gathering intelligence. And every major european country is doing the same thing.

We have been advising African host nations in proxy wars against the Chinese, Middle astern countries, Russia, and Muslim extremist groups since ww2, not all at the same time, and some more recent than others.

And if you want to know why Africa was a big target, its because Europe's colonialism and imperialism in Africa pre ww2 that was a major cause of Germany's uprising and the ascension of hitler, destabilized the entire continent exponentially more than it already was.

For ever country in Africa with US intel assets, there are also mainly French, and UK assets too.

France stoll holds power over 14 African nations and has veen fighting in virtually every one of those countries for the past 2-3 decades, and the UK has been assisting them, while the US has their own interests too.

Alot of the US interest stems from US embassy work.  There are contingency plans invoked on a weekly basis to protect US embassies in African nations. I kid you not, these operations and plans are invoked on a weekly basis due too security risks, and troops are moved around constantly and its all in the news, just very very silently. The info is all there, and its not even that secret. USMC literally reports their own media on these movements and things as long as operational security is held in check.

Wars are fought with the economy, cyber espionage, voter infiltration, social media swinging public opinions, and if need be, small skirmishes. Why waste money on physical wars when these tactics are way more effective?

Look at China having US companies censor their media to get  “chinese consumers.” That’s war.

Putin infiltrating US elections and having Russian bots spam social media. Trump getting elected and putting Putin above his own countries needs. It’s all part of an offensive.

2020-06-27 16:35:15,theluckywinner,"Sanctions are usually applied unilaterally by the USA to essentially bully targeted nations into submission. Finding reasons to justify the sanctions is also very easy, any government has some dirt on their hands, and that is even more true for developing countries. Europe and the rest of the world has no choice but to respect those sanctions if they want to trade with the USA, since otherwise they would be put at a huge economic disadvantage.

It is true that US hegemony has brought some stability to the Western world, but it came with the cost of oppressing other countries who didn't comply with the USA's will. As someone living in Canada I can't deny that we've profited massively from the stability brought by the USA, and we'll suffer when their power declines, but I won't deny that we're riding the wave of their atrocities."

China, on the other hand, is really throwing its weight around and giving no fucks.

2020-06-27 15:49:43,DCFY7439,"In the same week that Chinese and Indian soldiers engaged in a deadly brawl, one of China’s submarines cruised through the waters near Japan, prompting a scramble of aircraft and ships to track its furtive movements. Chinese fighter jets and at least one bomber buzzed Taiwan’s territorial airspace almost daily.

With the world distracted by the coronavirus pandemic, China’s military has encroached upon its neighbors’ territories on several fronts throughout the spring and now into summer, flexing its military might in ways that have raised alarms across Asia and in Washington.

China’s military assertiveness reflects a growing sense of confidence and capability, but also one of confrontation, particularly with the United States over the pandemic, the fate of Hong Kong and other issues that China considers central to its sovereignty and national pride.

China claims all of its recent operations are defensive, but each increases the risk of a military clash, whether intended or not. That appears to be what happened on the night of June 15, when Chinese and Indian soldiers fought along their disputed border in the Himalayas.

It was the bloodiest clash on that frontier since 1967. According to Chinese analysts, Indian news reports and American intelligence reports, it also caused an undisclosed number of Chinese deaths, the country’s first in combat since its war with Vietnam in 1979.

“I think the possibility of an accidental shot being fired is rising,” Wu Shicun, president of the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, said at a conference in Beijing this week, unveiling a report on American military activity in the region.

China has long acted forcefully to defend the country’s territory and interests, but it is now operating with greater military firepower than ever before.

“Its power is growing at a much greater rate than the other regional powers,” said Adam Ni, director at the China Policy Center, a research organization in Canberra, Australia. “This has really given Beijing more tools at its disposal to push its more assertive and aggressive agenda.”

The increased operational tempo this year follows a military modernization program that began in the 1990s and accelerated under China’s ambitious and authoritarian leader, Xi Jinping. He steadily purged the military’s top ranks of corrupt or insufficiently loyal officers and shifted the focus of the People’s Liberation Army from heavy ground battles to more agile joint operations using air, naval and, increasingly, cyberweapons.

Mr. Xi has also made the military an even greater priority in the wake of the pandemic. China’s premier, Li Keqiang, announced last month that the military budget would rise 6.6 percent this year, to nearly $180 billion, about a quarter of the American defense budget, even as overall government spending was set to decline because of the global economic slowdown.

At the National People’s Congress, Mr. Xi noted the role the military played in Wuhan, where the outbreak began in China, and warned that the pandemic posed challenges to national security. The country, he said, should “step up preparations for military struggles, flexibly carry out actual military training, and comprehensively improve our military’s ability to carry out military missions.”

China’s military is widely thought to remain far behind American armed forces, but it has caught up in some areas, including the expansion of its naval power and the deployment of anti-ship and antiaircraft missiles.

By the end of last year, China was believed to have at least 335 warships, more than the United States, which has 285, according to a report last month by the Congressional Research Service in Washington.

The report said China now posed “a major challenge to the U.S. Navy’s ability to achieve and maintain wartime control of blue-water ocean areas in the Western Pacific — the first such challenge the U.S. Navy has faced since the end of the Cold War.”

China has stepped up its military activity near Taiwan after the self-governing island’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, won re-election in January by beating a candidate viewed as less hostile to Beijing.

One of China’s two aircraft carriers cruised along the eastern coast of Taiwan in April, accompanied by five other warships. Chinese aircraft have repeatedly buzzed Taiwanese airspace in the last week, in what analysts said were tests of the island’s defenses. China plans to hold a military exercise in August that will reportedly simulate the seizure of Taiwan’s Pratas Islands, a cluster of atolls known in Mandarin as the Dongsha Islands.

China has also expanded its claims to the South China Sea, creating two new administrative districts to govern the islands it controls in the Paracel and Spratly chains and menacing other neighbors.

In April, China’s Coast Guard rammed and sank a Vietnamese fishing boat. The same month, a Chinese government research ship stalked an oil vessel in waters Malaysia claims as its own, prompting the United States and Australia to send four warships to monitor the situation. The Philippines lodged a formal diplomatic complaint after a Chinese warship pointed its targeting radar at a Philippine naval vessel.
In the East China Sea, the patrol by a Chinese submarine last week was the first detected since 2018, when Japanese warships forced a nuclear attack submarine to surface. It follows rising tensions over Japan’s administration of the Senkaku Islands, which the Chinese call the Diaoyu Islands.

“When China views it is being challenged in these other sovereignty disputes in this era, it will respond with a very tough line,” M. Taylor Fravel, director of the Security Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an expert on China’s military, said.

“China never had the ability to assert itself in the maritime domain until really in the last 10 or 15 years,” Mr. Fravel said, noting the steady buildup of China’s naval and air forces. He added, “That has enabled China to press its claims in the East and South China Sea more than before.”

It has also stepped up patrols in the skies over the region. Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., commander of the Pacific Air Forces who will soon take over as the Air Force chief of staff, said Wednesday that until recently China had only occasionally flown missions of its H-6 bombers but was doing so now on an almost daily basis.

Those bombers, while old, have been revamped and equipped with new missiles that China put on display at the military parade last October commemorating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.
For all of its recent activity, China’s military remains untested. The clash with the Indians was an isolated fight with rocks and clubs, not firearms, so it was hardly a test of Chinese military preparedness. It did raise questions about training and discipline.

Details of the incident remain sketchy and impossible to verify independently, but according to some accounts in the Indian news media, a tense, but manageable situation spiraled out of control because inexperienced replacements from other parts of Tibet did not observe the usual protocols for defusing confrontations.

China has not disclosed the number of casualties on its side, though a report by India Today, a major news outlet, said Indian forces turned over the bodies of 16 Chinese soldiers. An American intelligence official in Washington suggested that China was deliberately hiding its losses, which were comparable to India, ranging from 20 to 30.

Song Zhongping, an independent military analyst, said the figure was lower than the Indian claims but would not be released “to avoid stimulating intense sentiment in India.”

While the tensions with India are important, they are not the core Chinese military priority: confronting what it considers American aggression in China’s neighborhood.

The United States, too, has stepped up its military activity in the region. It has sent American warships through the South China Sea and stepped up support for Taiwan and its military — issues that came up this month when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met China’s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, in Hawaii.

The Chinese blame the United States for the tensions in the region, accusing the American military of routinely interfering in a region where it has no territorial claims.

Zhu Feng, executive director of the China Center for Collaborative Studies of the South China Sea, who also contributed to the report on American military activity there, warned that the possibility of confrontation would increase as the U.S. presidential campaign heated up.

“The United States has pinned China down with the two talons of the South China Sea and Taiwan issues,” he said."

2020-06-27 14:52:44,SovietBozo,"Yes, I believe you're right.  Enlargement of the Army from a (relatively) small core to major force of many divisions would (and should) be done thru voluntary recruitment. Just sweeten the deal until you get enough recruits. (The draft is a last resort for a major emergency.)
  
My basic point is that we shouldn't have an army large enough to fight a big war, at the ready. If you have one, the temptation to use it is too strong. It's like money burning a hole in your pocket. 
 
Maybe we should invade Iran or something. But if we do need to, it should be a big huge deal. It should require the passing of huge bills to start building weapons and equipment, and a huge recruitment effort, and be debated in the Congress and among the people. In a couple years, then we would be ready.  
  
This is how we used to do it. We had to ramp up from basically nothing to fight the Mexican War, the Civil War, World War I, and World War II.  

We had to stay ramped up while the Soviet Union was a military threat. But Russia is much weaker now. And, we took a lesson from WWII, from Munich: be always very strong to *prevent* anyone getting ideas. But Munich was a special, one off case. It was about 100 years ago and it need not dominate our thinking anymore."

And yes, a lot of non-military functions in research and other stuff the Army is good at. Intelligence, planning, and so on. (The Army basically started the internet, it was called DARPAnet at first -- Defense Advanced Research Projects Administration or something.)
  
But we don't need an army large enough to fight a big war without first having to go thru a big program of enlargement and training. If you have a huge army ready, there's too much temptation to use it. It's like money burning a hole in your pocket."

Russians (you flair as Russian?) would tell you that that is a matter between Russia and the Ukraine, and not the business of the United States to stick its nose in.

When the USSR broke up, Russia allowed large enclaves of ethnic Russians to be broken off from Russia. It probably thought this was good in helping keep places like Ukraine pro-Russian. Once Ukraine flipped to the West, though, Russia wanted its people back, and its people wanted to come back.

When you look at the situation in Ukraine, the land that Russia moved in and seized were places ethnic Russians were dominant. It's a very small land area in Donbass. I'm not saying it isn't shitty for Ukraine, it is. I support that the US is giving aid to the Ukraine to defend itself, but I'm not going to get all shocked and outraged that Russians are angry that we are openly and actively helping their enemy and hurting them, and trying to somehow hurt is in return."

**Millions of children could be pushed to the brink of starvation as the coronavirus pandemic sweeps across war-torn Yemen amid a ""huge"" drop in humanitarian aid funding, the U.N. children’s agency warned Friday.**


The stark prediction comes in a new UNICEF report, “Yemen five years on: Children, conflict and COVID-19.” It said the number of malnourished Yemeni children could reach 2.4 million by the end of the year, a 20% increase in the current figure.

“As Yemen’s devastated health system and infrastructure struggle to cope with coronavirus, the already dire situation for children is likely to deteriorate considerably,” warned UNICEF.

Yemen's poor health care infrastructure is unprepared to battle the coronavirus pandemic after five years of war between a Saudi-led military coalition and the Iran-backed Houthi rebels. The war, which has mostly stalemated, has also triggered the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.


The conflict erupted in 2015, when the Saudi-led coalition stepped in on behalf of the internationally recognized government, which the Houthis had forced into exile when they overran the capital, Sanaa, and much of the north the previous year.

The situation in Yemen is only expected to get worse as donor countries recently cut back on aid. Yemen has officially recorded more than 1,000 cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, including 275 deaths. However, the actual tally is believed to be much higher as testing capabilities are severely limited.

“If we do not receive urgent funding, children will be pushed to the brink of starvation and many will die,” said Sara Beysolow Nyanti, UNICEF's representative to Yemen. “The international community will be sending a message that the lives of children ... simply do not matter.”


**Pledging conference raises $1.35 billion**


UNICEF also warned that unless $54.5 million are disbursed for health and nutrition aid by the end of August, more than 23,000 children will be at increased risk of dying because of acute malnutrition. It also said that 5 million others under the age of 5 will not have access to vaccines against deadly diseases.

International relief agencies are alarmed by the significant decline in humanitarian funding promised earlier by donor countries. A virtual pledging conference for Yemen hosted by the U.N. and Saudi Arabia on June 2 saw 31 donors pledge $1.35 billion for humanitarian aid — a billion dollars short of what aid agencies needed and half of what countries had pledged in 2019.

UNICEF could only secure 40% of the $461 million it appealed for to cover its humanitarian response to the crisis in Yemen, and less than 10% of the $53 million it needs to handle the impact of COVID-19 on children, said the report.

“UNICEF is working around the clock in incredibly difficult situations to get aid to children in desperate need, but we only have a fraction of the funding required to do this,” said Nyanti.

The UNICEF report came on the heels of a warning by U.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock who told a closed U.N. Security Council meeting that Yemen could “fall off the cliff” without massive financial support.

Lowcock added that COVID-19 is spreading rapidly across the Arab world's poorest country, killing about 25% of confirmed cases — five times the global average.

Half of Yemen’s health facilities are dysfunctional and 18% of the country’s 333 districts have no doctors. Water and sanitation systems have collapsed resulting in recurrent cholera outbreaks. Around 9.6 million children do not have sufficient access to safe water, sanitation, or hygiene and two-thirds of the country’s roughly 30 million people rely on food assistance.

2020-06-27 10:22:05,DCFY7439,"On June 3, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta signed his first executive order of the year. Among other things, it listed a newly created Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS)—including functions such as health care, transportation, and public works—as part of the president’s office rather than an independent office in the county government system. The decision goes against the spirit of the 2010 Kenyan Constitution, which established county governments to promote democratic accountability by devolving some powers to the local level.

In March, Mike Sonko, the governor of Nairobi County, signed a deed of transfer with the national government. Under the terms of the deal, county functions would be administered by the national government through the new NMS. Air Force Maj. Gen. Mohamed Abdalla Badi was appointed the director-general by Kenyatta, and seven more senior military officers were added to the leadership ranks of the NMS two months later.

As Kenya reels from the coronavirus pandemic, a shift in power is underway in Nairobi, with municipal duties being transferred from elected public officials into the hands of military men. Even Sonko, who in April captured global attention for including bottles of Hennessy in coronavirus care packages for the public, has spoken out against the militarization. He says he was hoodwinked into signing documents he didn’t understand and has now taken the national government to court on the grounds that the deal is unconstitutional.

The militarization of Nairobi and the subsequent transfer of the county’s administration into the president’s office is a brazen power grab by Kenyatta; even more worrying is the fact that the moves have gone unchecked by Kenya’s parliament. With presidential elections due in 2022 and Kenyatta’s two-term limit up, the shift also raises questions about succession and whether he intends to attempt to remain in presidential office. Kenyatta’s allies are already clamoring to remove the term limits, and Kenyatta’s move to seize control of Nairobi raises questions about whether he will flout the norms again in two years.

The handover of Nairobi County to the office of the president has drawn angry reactions from critics, who view the move as an assault on Kenya’s democratic institutions. “To put it plainly, Uhuru Kenyatta is out of order,” Brenda Wambui, a Kenyan writer and public policy scholar, wrote in an email. The constitution “vests sovereignty in the Kenyan people, and Uhuru’s Executive Order is a direct attack on that sovereignty.”

Nairobi County is Kenya’s political and economic hub, controlling 21.7 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. And the Kenyatta family is one of Nairobi’s biggest landowners. It recently unveiled a plan to build a $5 billion urban development in Nairobi dubbed Northlands City. To some, the project is at the heart of the president’s power grab.

Economic control of the city is key to the Kenyatta family’s manufacturing dynasty, and Kenyatta has already successfully pursued, or attempted to pursue, changes elsewhere that tie in with his family’s business interests. For example, two Kenyatta family-owned construction firms figure heavily in deals to build affordable housing in the country, a hallmark project of the president’s administration.

However, Northlands City is the biggest ongoing Kenyatta family project. Once completed, the urban development is projected to have 250,000 people working and living within it. The plans have influenced key government decisions, such as the building of a $376 million interchange in Nairobi. The development is rumored to be the reason for a series of demolitions that rendered thousands homeless amid the coronavirus pandemic.

“We know that much of how Uhuru Kenyatta has strategized has to do with consolidating business interests and, as many have noted, I think the grabbing of Nairobi has to do with consolidating Northlands,” wrote Mumbi Kanyogo, a Kenyan activist, in a text message. “And if Nairobi is supposed to become an expat city, then we’re going to see mass displacement of poor Nairobians in ways that remind me of Nairobi’s colonial history, as well as the continued pushing out of middle-class renters to the outskirts of the city, possibly into Northlands.”

It is noteworthy that Kenyatta has chosen to use military officers to consolidate his power. Nairobi was never completely demilitarized after British rule ended in 1963, and it is still replete with strategic military installations that were intended to prevent a revolt or takeover by natives; since independence, the barracks have continued to serve a similar function. The Kenyan government relies on them to dispatch the military to quell dissent.

While military involvement in Kenya’s political institutions is not often overt, with Badi’s appointment to the NMS leadership, Kenyatta has made clear how he wishes power to be wielded in Nairobi—and the Kenyan military is key.

The militarization of the capital is just one of several unconstitutional moves by Kenyatta. The composition of several branches of his government violates constitutional mandates, including a rule that “not more than two-thirds of the members of elective or appointive bodies shall be of the same gender.” The president has also blatantly refused to appoint new judges to the country’s courts, leading to backlogs in the judicial system.

Kenyatta’s recent executive order also brought other independent offices under his authority, including the deputy president’s office and the judiciary. The action, which is illegal under the constitution, has raised questions about what Kenyatta is trying to achieve. Kenya’s chief justice, David Maraga, has pointed out that the president doesn’t have the power to transfer the judiciary or other state organs to his office’s control. Kenya’s constitution does not provide for an all-powerful president, but it seems to be what Kenyatta is trying to make himself, rolling back democratic gains in the process.

“We have separation of powers in our Constitution for a good reason,” Wambui wrote. “The separation of powers protects Kenyans’ right to be fairly represented and to seek legal redress, whilst stopping executive overreach, which is what Uhuru Kenyatta is attempting to do.”

Kenya’s history is replete with unilateral declarations from the president’s office. It is to this past that Kenyatta seeks to return. Kenyatta’s recent move in Nairobi is a brazen attempt to undermine democracy in the country, leading Kenya back to the type of imperial dictatorship imposed by his father, Jomo Kenyatta, and his successor, Daniel arap Moi."

2020-06-27 06:40:01,SHBGuerrilla,"

One of the largest issues our military faces is recruitment. Depending on the statistic, 70-75% of Americans between 17-24 are ineligible for service. Either they don’t have a highschool diploma or equivalent, they do and they’re not smart enough to enlist,  or they’re obese/unhealthy and unfit. 

Already there are an extreme number of hurdles just to find people who would be eligible to join. But beyond that, you need a military full of highly experienced, trained, and competent Officers and Non-Commissioned officers to train, organize and lead. You need people who are passionate about their profession, especially on the enlisted side. A military full of leaders who have no one to lead in a time of peace will only become complacent, incompetent, and stagnant. 

Don’t forget that a modern army isn’t just a bunch of grunts sweeping Sgt Major’s parking lot with tree branches plugged into their rifle barrels when they aren’t deployed. Running training facilities, training the hundreds of different jobs in each branch, schools, the overwhelming amount of paperwork and administration that is required for daily function and accountability. The role of our military training and developing diplomatic relations with foreign militaries. Aid and relief to victims of natural disasters home and abroad. These aren’t things that should be turned off for years and then restarted tomorrow. A strong army is as much a peace time diplomatic force as it is an angry bear roused from its cave in war.

TL;DR, Returning to a draft model, besides being immoral IMO, isn’t sustainable with the requirements of a modern army."

We do need a navy and an air force.   
  
We only border two other countries. Neither of them are going to invade us, and they couldn't do it as a surprise, and anyway our air force alone is very powerful. The Europeans can now easily take care of themselves, as Russia is much weaker than the Soviet Union was.

So what do we need an army for?  
  
We do need the ability to *form* an army at need. Thus we need a small army organization able to form the framework for a larger army. If the president had, before invading Iraq, had to run a very expensive two-year program to build a large land army, and find a way to greatly increase recruitment -- maybe a draft -- it would have put a brake on that. We could still raise a larger army *at extreme need*."

2020-06-27 05:17:02,Swedishtrackstar,"I would love an answer that doesn't directly point to the US economic system. From what I have seen and been exposed to, foreign wars have always been about the money. A huge portion of the US budget is placed on the military, and spending is rampant, sometimes on things [American troops don't even want](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unwanted-tanks-and-other-government-waste-detailed-in-reports/). 



The events of 9/11 were the only thing that has truly ""legitimized"" US involvement in the middle east, but even that is flawed since Al Qaeda only grew to prominence after the US funded their predecessor, [the mujahideen](https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jan/17/yemen.islam) under operation cyclone, all part of a proxy war to fight the communist USSR. By the end of the program, over half a billion dollars was being poured into a militant religious group half a world away, with large portions of that capital actually going to American and Western European arms manufacturers to equip these fighters.



And the most disgusting part of all of this? No one was, or ever will be, held accountable for the obscene waste of money and lives that took place. It's great that the United States ""succeeded"" in containing the Soviets, but at the end of the day, what was the point? Assuming the USSR conquered Afghanistan and established a warm water port, was that really a critical loss in the cold war? Considering that country had such a poor political system that it would fracture under its own weight just two years after pulling out of Afghanistan, was the subsidized radicalization of the middle east really worth tossing a couple billions to your group of political pals?"

I don't agree with what happen in the world with the US military, or really the US government, I hate it. Do you think I like the idea of people halfway across the world being fukin bombed from the sky, or those who were held in ""prisons"" and murdered or tortured. I wish it would've never happened, but there are others out there that would love the chance to do the same shit to others as well.

He was well travelled and probably saw how newly independent countries in the Americas during the 1800's treated the local indigenous populations.

2020-06-26 21:16:12,DCFY7439,"Kim Yo-jong, the only sister of North Korea’s supreme leader, Kim Jong-un, is now setting the tone of the country’s foreign policy. And if he is young and belligerent, she is younger and more belligerent still.

Early this month, after human rights activists in South Korea used balloons to send anti-North propaganda leaflets across the border, Kim Yo-jong [called them](https://time.com/5847884/north-korea-kim-yo-jong-leaflets-defectors/) “human scum” and “mongrel dogs.”

She faulted President Moon Jae-in of South Korea for failing to stop them and upbraided him for “putting his neck” into the “noose of pro-United States flunkeyism.”

She warned of “[action](https://asiatimes.com/2020/06/kims-sister-threatens-action-against-south/)” in reprisal, apparently threatening to destroy the Inter-Korean Liaison Office set up in 2018 to facilitate communication between the North and the South. And destroyed [it was](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/asia/north-korea-explosion-liaison-office.html).

She also threatened to [move troops into border regions](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/17/879030121/north-korea-vows-to-send-troops-into-border-cooperation-zones) that have been demilitarized.

But they weren’t. On Wednesday, Kim Jong-un [halted those plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/world/asia/north-koreas-troops-border-south-korea.html) — at least for the moment.

Some analysts have described the duet as a version of the classic [good cop (Jong-un), bad cop (Yo-jong)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/world/asia/north-korea-kim-jong-un.html) drill. But it really is more like a bad-cop, worse-cop routine.

Over the past two years, Kim Yo-jong’s stature at home and abroad has increased dramatically.

She was at her brother’s side during summit meetings with [Mr. Moon](https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/903520/gettyimages-951610938.jpg), [President Xi Jinping of China](https://editorial01.shutterstock.com/wm-preview-1500/9666131d/bdebeaff/north-korea-dalian-china-shutterstock-editorial-9666131d.jpg) and [President Trump](https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/NINTCHDBPICT000412703231.jpg). Less visible but no less significant: In late 2019, Kim Yo-jong reportedly was appointed as head of the [Department of Organization and Guidance](https://www.aei.org/events/north-koreas-control-tower-the-organization-and-guidance-department/), the formal locus of political power in North Korea, where all key personnel decisions related to the party, the military and the bureaucracy are made.

Yet it was only this March that she first issued a formal statement under her own name: It [ridiculed](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200304000766) Mr. Moon, calling him “mentally challenged” and a “frightened dog.” Then it was she who publicly acknowledged that [Mr. Trump had sent a letter to her brother](https://apnews.com/1723eb67c3f9822b8b4f3d0dea38f012) offering help in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. She now also runs the United Front Department, which is in charge of South Korea policy.

Informally, she has played the roles of spokeswoman to her brother, chief of staff and national security adviser. Shortly after the curious episode earlier this spring during which [Kim Jong-un largely disappeared from view](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/opinion/kim-jon-un-north-korea.html) — prompting rumors that he might be incapacitated, perhaps even dead — and then reappeared, she became the face of the regime.

Accelerating efforts to bolster the leadership credentials of Kim Yo-jong is a sensible strategy from Pyongyang’s point of view.

A pandemic — unlike a famine (which North Korea has experienced) or a military attack (which it fears) — can kill princes as readily as paupers. The children of Kim Jong-un, who is said to be 36, are too young to succeed him any time soon. Again on Thursday, the Japanese government said it had [“suspicions”](https://twitter.com/willripleyCNN/status/1276158323503628288) about his health.

Kim Yo-jong, reportedly in her early 30s, has much to prove — and she might well do some of that proving, at least in the short or medium term, by ratcheting up two staple features of the Kim regime’s strategy of self-preservation: calculated external threats and extreme internal repression.

In 2012, his very first year in power, Kim Jong-un, then not yet 30, oversaw [two long-range missile tests](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/12/world/asia/north-korea-launches-rocket-defying-likely-sanctions.html). There is no reason to think that Kim Yo-jong would be any less aggressive or tyrannical than her brother — or their father and grandfather — and she may even be more so. The nature of the regime she represents, and will perhaps one day inherit, almost demands it.

That a woman would now be the surrogate supreme leader of North Korea — a male-dominated culture, politically and otherwise — is a first, but it isn’t heresy. Ensuring that the Kim family’s authority remains unchallenged supersedes any social conventions.

The ideological foundation of the regime rests on [the supposedly near-superhuman, revolutionary leadership](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/16/north-korea-kim-jong-il-birthday) of the country’s founding leader and his direct progeny.

Kim Jong-un’s older brother, [Kim Jong-chol](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/05/22/the-sad-story-of-kim-jong-chul-the-north-korean-leaders-brother-and-eric-clapton-megafan/), has no political acumen or interests, their father, Kim Jong-il, used to say.

[Kim Pyong-il](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/N-Korea-at-crossroads/Kim-Jong-Un-s-uncle-Pensioner-or-soon-to-be-purged), a half brother of Kim Jong-il’s, having long lived in semi-exile in Eastern Europe, is treated more like a distant relative than as a core member of the Kim clan’s rarefied [“Mount Paektu bloodline.”](https://kcnawatch.org/newstream/1582104648-783371404/a-general-of-the-mt-paektu-type/) At best, he is to be watched and contained. At worst, his life, like the lives of [another uncle](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/north-korea-announces-execution-of-kim-jong-uns-uncle-jang-song-thaek/2013/12/12/060b18ac-637d-11e3-91b3-f2bb96304e34_story.html?_=ddid-2-1587774660) and [a half brother](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/world/asia/kim-jong-nam-assassination-north-korea.html) of Kim Jong-un’s, could prove precarious and short.

Kim Yo-jong appears to be [the sole viable torchbearer](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/north-koreas-fabled-mount-baekdu-bloodline) today.

For decades, North Korea’s leaders have cleverly constructed an image of weirdness. They project buffoonish bellicosity, for example, so they can peddle any dialing down later as progress, a breakthrough, a concession.

Diversion and psychological manipulation are fixtures of Pyongyang’s diplomatic playbook. Now the advent of Kim Yo-jong may offer the regime a chance to exploit, among other things, Mr. Trump’s sexism for tactical gain — and this whether she plays hardball or the part of gentle charmer.

Thursday marked the anniversary of the beginning of the Korean War in 1950, which was triggered by the North’s invasion of the South. Some of us expected Pyongyang to commemorate the day with some military provocation. It didn’t, but something like that almost surely is in the offing.

Expect a goad, a jab, one outrage or another, certainly *some* challenge ahead of the election in the United States — anything to throw off Mr. Trump, beleaguered as he is by the pandemic, mass protests and a historic economic crisis. And don’t be surprised if Kim Yo-jong delivers it."

Love it or hate it the US has the most technologically and doctrinally advanced military across the board compared to any other nation. Largely due to massive spending,  coupled with mastery of combined arms doctrine, and processing the most combat experience of any nation on earth.(for modern times)

Basically the general goal for the US military is to be 10+ years ahead of everyone else in every field. As a result of that no country can realistically hope to match the US punch for punch in every aspect of military combat. As a result they will choose a couple of areas to focus on and try to outpace the US in or at least match. 

For example: 
China has focused on cyber warfare and land based ballistic missiles, allowing them to keep the US navy at arms length from their ports, and cyber warfare to counter US cyber attacks and drone use.

Russia on the other hand choose several other areas to focus on, one of which being anti air emplacements of such high quality that they stand a real chance against the US airforce, which is a huge achievement by itself. Due to the shear size and technological sophistication of the US airforce.

What I'm getting at is that the only way to actually win against the US military in a stand up fight is through a coalition where everyone takes one piece to specialize in and works together. Otherwise the only other way to win a war with the US (and survive) is through public opinion on the US homefront. Make the war too unpopular at home and the US will turn tail regardless of their military power and standing, that's what the north vietnamese showed the world. 

Which is exactily why, if the US ever hopes to win a war and maintain its safety, spends so much on its military. So they can stay 10+ years ahead of everyone else, allowing them to win any conflict quickly, with minimal effort and sacrifice."

2020-06-26 19:20:04,Langernama,"#Coronavirus and Merkel's quest for legacy speed up German rebalancing
BERLIN (Reuters) - A coronavirus-induced plunge in German exports and a fiscal U-turn by Chancellor Angela Merkel as she seeks to cement her place in history are accelerating a long demanded rebalancing of Europe’s largest economy.

For years, Germany’s huge trade surpluses and its hesitancy to stimulate domestic demand with substantial infrastructure spending have frustrated international organizations and European allies who argue Berlin could do more at home to support growth elsewhere.

The trade surplus has also been used by U.S. President Donald Trump to underline his America First narrative that Germany was exploiting the United States, the world’s largest economy.

But with the coronavirus pandemic disrupting trade across the globe and Merkel turning Germany’s traditionally cautious fiscal policy upside down, its current account surplus - a wider measure of international flows - is shrinking fast, according to projections from its central bank and finance ministry.

There are signs that this shift could last. Merkel and Finance Minister Olaf Scholz are willing to suspend the debt brake - constitutionally enshrined rules which significantly curb German stimulus borrowing - again next year, three government officials told Reuters.

The conservative leader and the centre-left vice chancellor are also determined to strengthen the European Union at a time when its cohesion has been rocked by Britain’s departure and challenges from the United States and China, the sources said.

After decades of German resistance, Merkel and Scholz are backing an unprecedented 500 billion euros of joint European debt issuance to aid member states worst hit by COVID-19 and tackle growing discrepancies in the bloc.

“Merkel is worried about two things: that a second wave of infections could force authorities to implement another lockdown and that Europe could break apart because of the crisis,” said one of the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.

After 15 years in power and with her chancellorship coming to a self-determined end with the general election next year, Merkel now has room to act more freely and think more about how history will judge her, a second senior official told Reuters.

“With Germany taking over the rotating EU presidency for six months from July, there was always the plan to breathe more life into the pledge of European solidarity,” the official said.

“The coronavirus crisis accelerated this and underlined the urgency to act even more boldly now,” the official added.

The German central bank expects the pandemic to slash exports by more than 13% in 2020 while imports are only predicted to fall by 7%.

“This together creates downward pressure on the trade surplus and with it the current account surplus,” Bundesbank chief economist Jens Ulbrich told Reuters.

[[Graph](https://graphics.reuters.com/GERMANY-ECONOMY/rlgpdlkejpo/chart.png)]: ^(Germany’s current account surplus shrinks, )

The central bank expects the latter surplus to fall below 5% of economic output this year from above 7% in 2019. This would be the lowest level since 2005 and sharply down from a peak of 8.6% reached in 2015.

“With the recovery of the global economy, the balance will increase again by 2022, but without reaching the levels of previous years,” Ulbrich said.

The European Commission, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) all expect the surplus to shrink too, though to a smaller extent.

They are also unsure if the German rebalancing will last beyond the pandemic.

“Whether the effect is temporary will depend in part on the rebound in global demand for capital goods. The Chinese economy is shifting towards a more consumption-led growth model, which will reduce the demand for German exports more permanently,” Andrew Barker, head of the Germany desk at the OECD Economics Department, told Reuters.

Germany’s large stimulus package, financed with record new borrowing of 218.5 billion euros this year, is having a clear effect this year, but the future budget path is not certain.

Nora Hesse, a Berlin-based economic advisor to the European Commission, said German savings were likely to remain high due to its ageing population while public and private sector investment were still subdued.

“That’s why the European Commission continues to recommend Germany increase its investment in the green and digital transformation of its economy, in training and education, research and innovation, as well as in housing,” Hesse said.

Shekhar Aiyar, the IMF’s mission chief for Germany, cautioned that a drop in the current account surplus might be temporary and recommended Berlin continue its growth-oriented fiscal policy beyond the current crisis.

The IMF sees the surplus remaining above 6 percent of GDP in the medium term, supported by growing investment income flows from large net foreign assets, Aiyar said.

As striking as German fiscal efforts to tackle the coronavirus crisis have been, Berlin will remain under pressure from international bodies and its euro zone neighbours to stay the course.

“Germany’s surplus in recent years borders on mercantilism and has been a blight on the world economy,” Harvard University economist Dani Rodrik told Reuters, but he added that Berlin’s fiscal response to the crisis was impressive.

“Especially during the pandemic, Germany should not be a contributor to recession in the rest of the world.”"

2020-06-26 17:37:04,Jaracgos,"\&gt;Three people are believed to have died after an incident at a hotel in Glasgow city centre. It is thought that two people were fatally stabbed before the attacker was shot dead by armed police.

\&gt;Six people are being treated in hospital for their injuries, including a police officer who was said to be ""critical but stable"".

\&gt;Police Scotland said the situation was ""contained"" and there was no danger to the general public. Armed officers remain at the scene outside the Park Inn in West George Street.

\&gt;First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said reports of the incident were ""truly dreadful"" and she was being ""updated as the situation becomes clearer"".

\&gt;She added: ""My thoughts are with everyone involved.""

\&gt;Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""deeply saddened by the terrible incident in Glasgow"".

\&gt;A senior Whitehall source has told the BBC the motive for the stabbings is still being investigated and it is ""too early"" to say if it is related to terrorism.

\&gt;Police Scotland Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson urged people to avoid the area. He said police were not looking for anyone else in relation to the incident. 

\&gt;""The individual who was shot by armed police has died ... Six other people are in hospital for treatment to their injuries including a police officer, who is in a critical but stable condition,"" he said.

\&gt;It is understood that the Park Inn Hotel is currently being used to house asylum seekers.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;One witness, who gave his name as John, said he came down from the third floor of the hotel to see the reception covered in blood. He told the PA news agency that he initially saw one person who had been stabbed.

\&gt;""I went down to the entrance and shouted at him and told him to stay calm and I will call for help,"" he said.

\&gt;He then saw another man, who was ""fighting for his life""."

2020-06-26 17:33:07,Apathetic_Zealot,"&gt;People should be hired according to competence.

This is one of the biggest myths about affirmative action and plays into implicit racism. It's not about hiring incompetent blacks, it's about putting competent blacks higher on the hiring list.

&gt;Equality means very thing is the same across the board no special treatment for anyone  and that is what we should strive for. 

How should we reverse centuries of discrimination by treating every one equal? LBJs metaphore of the foot race shows why this is nonsense.

Imagine black and white runners at the starting line of a race track. The black one starts in chains. The race starts, the white runner obviously has a commanding lead in the race. So after the chains come off there is a large gap in progress. How do you reverse that gap? Treating them both equally doesn't create equality.

&gt;MLKs ""I have a dream"" resonates with me deeply and should be something we all want.

If you're a fan of MLK you should read his letter from Birmingham Jail. In it he talks about what justice it. And how no matter what he does, no matter how peaceful, whites will always say his movement is the problem. So when you say you don't like BLM, remember what MLK says."

2020-06-26 17:06:25,Andodx,"As a white male, in a society predominantly built for white males, by white males. Yes, I believe that I have it pretty easy, in comparison to PoC, migrants and others that are not like me, a white male. 

I do not fear the police or what they might do when they ""randomly"" select me  for an inspection because I might have drugs on me. I don't have to worry about systemic racism impacting my job hunt or my career paths, employers are like me and know how to deal with me. People don't switch the side of the street when they see my skin color. I don't get accused of bank fraud in the super market because the cashier can't believe that I am able to afford the type of groceries I bought and calls the police. Just to repeat a few examples. 

There are a lot of simple daily life things I don't have to think about and PoC do have to mind and navigate them. I can steamroll through certain situations of live, where PoC have to be extremely careful to get through them. 

Sure there are issues white males have to face and live can be harsh for everyone. But the trouble for PoC is in part that we, white males, designed it that way and in part that it historically grew into what it is today. Its not just life itself that is making it hard or bad luck, e.g. because you were born into a household with an unemployed alcoholic. Its the system that is stacked against their skin color, religion, cultural heritage, etc., in addition to life being unfair in general. 

If you are looking for proof, go and watch the news and reflect on what makes people go out and protest in a global pandemic. Go and follow PoC leaders on social media, read their stories and listen to their view on the system. Reflect on what you are learning and think about what would have happened to you in that situation. If that does not convince you that there is something inherently wrong in how the world we built works, I am not able convince you otherwise."

But to make sure we are talking about the same thing, its about the organization behind [blacklivesmatter.com](https://blacklivesmatter.com/). Right? 

If so, their [Campaign Goals](https://blacklivesmatter.com/blms-whatmatters2020-goals-and-focus/) are beyond my interest, as it is exactly what I described above, how to get in a position of power and achieve their campaign focus. This is a very traditional lobbying campaign, the very thing needed to inject the change they want to see.  

Never the less, their [Campaign Focus](https://blacklivesmatter.com/blms-whatmatters2020-goals-and-focus/) is what is having an influence outside of the US as well and where I find several connections to what is going on in my home country Germany as well.

See, I am not disagreeing with you this. But then it becomes about ending police brutality or reforming criminal justice system. You will be hard pressed to find one person who doesn't agree with these issues.

Countries are usually easily concerned with any conflict of interest their diplomats may develop by staying too long in the same place. Which is why diplomats only get temporary affectations (3-4 years in one country).

Allowing them to hold an academic office there is in direct contradiction with that. Unless your goal is explicitly to have a pawn in said university, as seems to be the case here.

My first question is about this piece: 

&gt;But the stats show that there is not much evidence of police disproportionately killing unarmed black people compared to any other races. That's where the message doesn't hit.

The presented problem is more complex than a single statistic can show, as there is a lot of factors at work and most of them are not collected or are compiled by the security forces, who are not trusted or are hiding the results since their publication is not mandatory for them.

&gt;But BLM as a movement is very ineffective. It is a tool for the Corporations to co-opt the movement to act like they are super liberal and progressive while doing nothing for the betterment of the PoC and a tool for the Democratic party to co-opt the movement to ensure black people keep voting for them while they also don't do jackshit when they are in control of White Hous, Senate or Congress.

2020-06-26 13:12:22,iamlamboh,"Haha, brilliant! So because I've asked you to substantiate your ideas and you can't, I'm a child. Just make wild sweeping generalisations online pal, go on. Ok so rather than backing up your argument you've asked for my take, so here we go. Briefly...also I'm answering on my phone. I'll go in on desktop after posting to add sources.

To address your first question, it all depends on how you look at this - there are vast differences between gender equality in 'west' Vs 'east', which I'll acknowledge now. In Tanzania for example, many young girls are subject to genital mutilation, or having their clitorises removed in order to silence any sexual desires. In the UK this practice is of course banned and women have freedom over their sexual and reproductive health and free health care accross the board. Afghan girls have been shot in the head on the school bus, while British girls have full access to school. If we look at a western country like Britain in 2020 you could argue either way about us being a partiarchal society based on our relative rates and severity of gender inequality, gender based violence and sexual discrimination to those in the 'east'. 

Is gender a social concept? Again this is much departed within gender studies. As somebody else said this is almost the nature/nurture take on the topic - a lot of scholars say yes - for example Judith Butler says that gender is something we perform, we are socialised into developing gender specific behaviours and we enact these to enforce our identity (she uses the act of drag to make her point - people can perform the gender they want to be recognised as) and this relates to trans people changing their gender identity and then perhaps acting in what we perceive to be masculine or feminine traits.

And your follow up question, no I don't find that problematic that biology influences behaviour. Gender as a social construct and biological sex as a physical marker don't have to be mutually exclusive ideas - we all have genes which make up our biological sex, for example males having more muscle mass and strength. Yes women can be strong, but males and females do have biological differences and this is why there are separate male and female categories for competitive sport. In terms of behaviour, gender and sex differences are well documented."

&gt; Left unstated in their public demand is that the Houthis themselves may be willing to set the ship on fire if they see the possibility of the takeover of the port, which not so long ago was considered a vital point of attack for the Arab Coalition forces who were hoping to make a comeback and drive the Houthis completely out of the city.

2020-06-26 12:59:17,Andodx,"Happy to have this discussion, as it is an important one. 

Let me iterate why I'm in favor of PoC quotas based on my own experience with quotas for women. 

The topic of quotas first came into my field of view with the public discussion on women quotas for publicly traded german company boards, back in 2016/17'ish. At first I was against this with the same argument, best person for the job should get the it. Another argument was, that the others know about the quote based decision and just have the person on board in order to fulfill the quota and wont take her seriously. So we would disservice women with this. 

Boy was I naive and ignorant about how the career system works for women. In reality without a quota at the top there is no reason for a company to make sure Women are represented in the trainings and programs leading people to become qualified for more senior leadership positions. Companies more often than not do not have the will or the funds to create extra positions just to fulfill the quota so they have to invest in training them. 

At the same time, current leaders grow up in and are led by an old boys club. They will do their utmost to protect and recreate this ecosystem of like minded people with similar experiences to them so their experience in navigating the social structure they know stays relevant. A quota will force the old boys club to diversify, something they would never do on their own volition, as it is against their interests. 

A quota will force companies to make sure that there is ample supply of female/PoC talent to keep the business compliant, running and successful. Imho the later one is the key, as in order to get  someone to be qualified for a C-Level position, you need years of experience and dedicated trainings. 

The quota at the top ensures that companies have to actively include women in their career planning. Because if they don't, they will have to acquire the qualified talent at a market rate, in turn making qualified women &amp; PoC a rare, expensive and sought after resource for companies. And the rate will be higher than what they are used to, as the cost of their decision is ""male + penalty"" vs. ""women"".  

With a little bit of time this demand will reflect on the universities and schools, they will see the increased demand by companies and adjust their selection processes in order to stay represented and relevant in the their desired workplaces and target companies. 

And Money and usable market situations is where you always get the business people with.  

Source: I am a business person and the team I lead is 100% measured on its bottomline impact for the company. If I don't use a new market situation opening up before, someone else will and I lose my chance to climb up the ladder with the growth coming from the situation. 

On a personal note, diversity is good for the workplace, its culturally enriching and injects new ways of thinking into the problem solving process. As different upbringings and experiences lead to different conclusions/solutions."

2020-06-26 12:52:20,DCFY7439,"Okay. But to me this issue seems like about Equal Opportunity which I 100% agree on. There definitely exists a gap specially in US where the protest movement started. 

But the issue is the movement is called ""Black Lives Matter"" supposedly protesting against Police killing of unarmed Black people. But the stats show that there is not much evidence of police disproportionately killing unarmed black people compared to any other races. That's where the message doesn't hit. 

If it was about ending racial discrimination from every facets about our society, most people agree. But the way BLM movement is conducted just doesn't connect with a lot of people. 

I am not white. I have lived in Europe for a considerable period of time. I know about the problem. But BLM  as a movement is very ineffective. It is a tool for the Corporations to co-opt the movement to act like they are super liberal and progressive while doing nothing for the betterment of the PoC  and a tool for the Democratic party to co-opt the movement to ensure black people keep voting for them while they also don't do jackshit when they are in control of White Hous, Senate or Congress."

2020-06-26 12:45:00,Langernama,"#Tiny Forests Are Springing Up All Around Europe, Inspired By Japan, to Help Restore Biodiversity
Using the methods of Japan’s most famous botanist, European countries are beginning to dot their urban landscapes with tiny forests, as productive and biodiverse as any in wilderness areas, yet sometimes only as big as a tennis court.

The idea is that volunteers can plant densely-packed clusters of seedlings from indigenous plants to create a small functional ecosystem that can restore soil, protect resources like water and air quality, and act as a biodiversity hotspot that can have a measurable effect on both the local and regional environment.

Akira Miyawaki was the botanist who in 1970 observed that trees around Japan’s Shinto and Buddhist shrines tended to be native species, well-adapted to the soil and climate of the islands of Japan.

He later found that only 0.06% of contemporary Japanese forests were indigenous forests, with the sizable remainder populated by non-native tree species, or planted in unnatural ways.

He pioneered a method of restoring indigenous forests on degraded or deforested land which had been devoid of humus. It came to be known as the Miyawaki method. Using this formula he created over 1,700 forests throughout Asia, 96.7% of which developed into a resilient ecosystem within ten years.

##Miyawaki in Europe
Growing more than 10x faster, and possessing up to 20x more biodiversity potential than contemporary forests, the Miyawaki method is perfect for organizations like [Urban Forests](http://urban-forests.com/results-2/) in France and Belgium, and the [Tiny Forest initiative](https://resilientthehague.nl/en/projects/tiny-forests/) in Holland, with their strong desire to prevent the worst of climate change upon their nations’ relatively small landmass.

[[Image](https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Urban-Forest-in-Belgium-Urban-Forests-Instagram.jpg)]: ^(Urban Forest in Belgium – Instagram @urbanforestsbelgium)

On March 2nd Urban Forests finished a 22-species, 1,200-tree Miyawaki forest in Toulouse, France, planted on 400 square meters—the first such forest in Toulouse.

“The plantations are made in a very dense way, in order to favor the cooperation between the species,” Audrey, one of Urban Forests’ volunteers [explained](https://actu.fr/occitanie/toulouse_31555/toulouse-ont-plante-une-micro-foret-urbaine-1200-arbres-juste-cote-peripherique_31971085.html?fbclid=IwAR3f1NZKSIMLqQQI37ZENvtYyMQro4lkqyxoluHw8FdKFYYzNy9WVsOCrdU) to _Actu Toulouse._ “It captures more CO2 and trees grow up to ten times faster than in a conventional forest.”

It’s just one of many Urban Forests’ projects, and the fifth that the nonprofit has completed this year. In total their Miyawaki forests across Belgium and France consist of 21,000 trees over 7,000 square meters.

The Tiny Forest Initiative started in 2015 in the Dutch city of Zaandam by the Institute for Nature Education and Sustainability (IVN), has created [100 Miyawaki forests across the country](https://www.ivn.nl/tinyforest/onze-bossen), and had planned an additional 30 for the first three months of 2020.

In 2017, ecologists at Wageningen University in Holland examined the newly planted mini-forests and [concluded](https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/536595) that tiny forests “increase the biodiversity compared to the nearby forest. Both the number of species groups and the number of individuals is generally higher than in the reference forests.”

They also found that biodiversity was improved because sunlight was able to reach more species of local plants known to local pollinators. The forests also provided “more variety in food and shelter for a higher diversity of animals like insects, snails, butterflies, amphibians, bugs, grasshoppers.”

“This is a great thing to do,” said wildlife researcher Eric Dinerstein in a [recent scientific publication](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/4/eaaw2869). “So this could be another aspect for suburban and urban areas, to create wildlife corridors through contiguous ribbons of mini-forest.”"

Hey i agree with the sentiment of BLM but not with the organisation. The organisation. And I genuinely think they are the reason BLM is getting a bad rep. 

I don't think it's fair to say there should be a quota for black people certain positions. People should be hired according to competence. Maybe you'd say black people are in high poverty situations, then that is a problem that needs to be fixed to get the right resources and tools across and remove people from poverty regardless of race. The BLM organisation supports segregation, something that we as a society fought with blood and tears against.  

Equality means very thing is the same across the board no special treatment for anyone  and that is what we should strive for. 

MLKs ""I have a dream"" resonates with me deeply and should be something we all want.

2020-06-26 11:39:47,EduBA,"&gt;*Since the age of Covid dawned about six months ago, rulers the world over have been insisting that all their decisions – especially the ones they fear could prove unpopular – are based on Science, with a capital S, so it is irrational to object to any of their policies. However, even though that spiky little thing which worms its way into our bodies and then goes about deconstructing them shows no signs of going away and the longed-for vaccine has yet to be invented, an increasing number of governments are looking for alternatives to the lockdowns and social-distancing ordered by the epidemiologists who are allegedly behind all the decisions that really count.* 

&gt;*It is not that politicians are losing faith in Science. It is, rather, that Science can be as fearfully stern a taskmaster as was its predecessor, God, back in the days when his (or His) word was law, At any rate, that is what some who claim to speak in its name evidently think should be the case. Before the coronavirus made its appearance, most allusions to “the Science” and the need to obey it came from people convinced that, unless carbon emissions were drastically reduced almost overnight, global warming would soon render much of the planet uninhabitable. Anyone who suggested that they could be wrong and pointed out that average temperatures have been rising and falling since long before mankind arrived on the scene, got treated as an enemy of Science who deserved to be put on trial for heresy.*

&gt;*As well as health workers, who encounter it several times a day, another group of “vulnerable” people is the one formed by politicians who enjoy getting into close physical contact with potential supporters and greatly dislike wearing masks in public. Donald Trump and his Brazilian counterpart Jair Bolsonaro have been harshly criticised for their reluctance to hide their faces in the approved manner; so too have many Argentine politicos, including Alberto who has also been filmed warmly embracing individuals (like Formosa’s long-time boss Gildo Insfrán) he wants to keep on side.* 

&gt;*Throughout the world, complaints about the tyranny of “Science” are becoming more frequent. We are not laboratory rats, people say, and demand that other factors be taken into account. Many want policy-makers to pay more heed to the views of economists, sociologists and psychologists who warn us that the consequences of more months of lockdown and enforced social-distancing could be every bit as unpleasant as the fate awaiting those who catch the virus. They are surely right. If, as now looks likely, we are about to experience a great depression comparable to the one which helped set the stage for World War II, millions more could die prematurely and hundreds of millions of others spend the rest of their lives in extreme poverty.*"

Tired of him? His support group is military, police, pensioners, state employees, older people unwilling to learn and people who lack skills and are afraid to lose their government-backed jobs. And that's a lot of people.

Especially ardent supporters of him are cynical wealthy people with connections, or those who are aspiring to be them, and socially conservative men in their +60s who watch the TV and are crazy about geopolitics.  
There's no common general stance, since the society is really divided, especially by the media they consume. Generally, it's the TV vs the Internet, and the pro-liberal Internet vs the pro-authoritatian Internet. If we'll leave out the TV audience, the general perception of the Internet-consuming audience tends to be more critical, seeing him as getting more senile and detached from reality, still going around with the old attitude of giving vague socially patronizing and patriotic speeches, and behaving like his motto is: ""Pay your taxes and ask for no help. The state owes nothing to you. Also, respect us and whatever non-sense we believe in"". 

There's a phrase that appeared in public vocabulary when the oil prices plummeted, – ""People are the new oil"", and there's a subtle suspicion growing, that since oil is becoming less profitable, he'll try to squeeze that profit from exploiting the people somehow, damaging their income growth even more."

Of course all lives matter. Black lives matter is about making sure that PoC get the same rights we white males are enjoying, as this is currently not the case. By no means does this mean black lives need to matter more than others. 

When you say #allLivesMatter, you are stating that you do not recognize the need for the awareness of the PoC's struggle to achieve the same standard in society we white males are on. Which in turn makes you look like you are a racist that is ok with the societal mistreatment of PoC. 

So yes all lives mater and are important to protect, but PoC are in need of our help to make sure they get on the same level we white males are. Same goes for #EqualPay.

If you don't back up your own claims and arguments with fact based evidence and proper academic sources (not something you read on BuzzFeed about Feminists that triggered you) then your argument has no validity beyond some guy just rambling off his opinions. In the academic world you can't write anything without it being fact checked, peer reviewed and torn to shreds - as should be the case. 

As students in an undergraduate degree you actually have to back up all your arguments in your essays and reference or site each and every claim you mention. These sources have to be academic standard books or journals and therefore have been peer reviewed and picked to shreds before the book even reached the publisher. This means unsubstantiated claims don't last 2 minutes in the academic world.

2020-06-26 09:48:48,iamlamboh,"Cmon, this is an issue of censorship rather than academic credibility. The theme of gender studies does indeed reappear throughout the disciplines of Humanities and Social Sciences, but also in Business Studies, Management Science and Organisational Work and Technology.

It looks like you have broadly misunderstood the remit of the discourse. I minored in Gender Studies as part of my Politics and Sociology degree, and I can tell you now fashion trends and stereotypes are not the focus of the class, and that a degree based on those themes would not stand the rigour of academic quality assurances (ie. That course wouldn't exist at top global institutions if it wasn't academically robust).

We looked at performative elements of gender and how that feeds into power dynamics and quality of life. Gender studies looks at intersections like race, class, disability - feminism is not just about the female sex, but about diversity of experiences between different groups of people, and how injustices or inequality can be experienced differently accross different groups within a population. For example, part of my GS lectures were delivered by a Sociologist of Medicine, who taught of the different lived experiences of patients and doctors based on their race/class/gender identity. This is actually a relevant and useful discipline, if you think it's just about skirts and periods then you are woefully uninformed my dude."

2020-06-25 23:38:36,dekachin5,"From the article:

&gt;Europeans bridle at the abuse of the EU’s economic openness, used by China to suck up assets and intellectual property (IP) and otherwise advance its geopolitical interests. Its cyber-attacks, its crackdown in Hong Kong and its opaqueness over Covid-19 alarm them too. The shift is uneven among member states, but even in Berlin scepticism is growing. After a virtual EU-China summit on 22 June, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, called China a “systemic rival” and stressed disagreements over IP, investment and human rights.

&gt;China’s “Belt and Road” investments in Myanmar, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and (particularly) Pakistan stir Indian fears of encroachment; these are exacerbated by the growing economic imbalance; and Beijing’s handling of the pandemic has soured popular perceptions in India. Tensions over the countries’ Himalayan border have grown and on 15 June a skirmish in the Galwan Valley killed more than 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese ones, in the first fatal clash at the border since 1975.

&gt;Russian-Chinese relations, like Indian-Chinese relations, are marked by a clear imbalance of power and wealth. Vladimir Putin is fiercely protective of his country’s independence and can see in his own near abroad – in Belarus, Serbia and across central Asia – how tightly Beijing grips dependent allies. Moreover, writes Pavel K Baev of the Brookings Institute, “the Covid-19 pandemic has aggravated hidden tensions and accentuated mutual mistrust” between Moscow and Beijing. 

So basically the article doesn't follow the headline. The article is arguing that countries are mostly shifting away from China."

2020-06-25 22:46:58,ar1819,"As with everything - it depends. People who were born before 1985 mostly support him (with some saying that he is not radical enough) That's because people do not miss USSR but they miss having a strong political figure. Also with their experience during 90s they tend to see democracy as a sham where rich get richer, poor get poorer, and criminals are everywhere. That experience is not someone you can relate easily on - you had to be an adult in Russia during 90s to see how chaotic and downright bad it was. It's no wonder people see Putin as some sort of savior - 2000s were basically the years where it got from bad to normal and then, to, well, good. It got worse in some regards in the last few years(in some ways it got better, despite half of the internet thinking that Russia is crippled/dying/whatever), but nowhere to the level of 90s. There is hovewer strong opposition in this group (regular guests of echo.msk. ru, novayagazeta, etc) but they are in the minority. 

Then you get to the people who were born before 2000s - those do not felt the impact of 90s that hard, so they do not have PTSD and crippling fear of that happing again. But since their childhood and teenage years were 90s they got somewhat cynical view and mostly indifferent.

The last group is people who were born after 2000 -most of those actually are in strong opposition to him. That is because despite having a huge economical boom in 2000s, the 2010s ended with recession and no clear view on the future from either Putin or the United Russia (ruling party) and the government starts to look not only corrupt (which is expected in Russia lol) but also hilariously incompetent. This group also had Internet their entire life so they have the constant ability to compare current situation with other countries.

This analysis in quite incomplete and do not include things like Crimea/Ukraine/Syria/China/US etc. Despite reddit thinking that Russia == Putin, this is not true. Russian politics are quite complex and even Putin has to consider interests of oligarchy, FSB and army, and general population.

Edit: Fixed spelling."

There’s also that core support group (fucking vatniks) that loves Putin and his nationalist bullshit but I feel like the opinions on Putin are legit the worst they have been in years because of the 2018 retirement age reform, the way the cuntry is dealing with pandemic which could’ve been better (for example, if you’re a resident of Moscow, in case of contracting the virus you have to stay at home for two weeks (makes sense) and you have to have a special app installed on your phone which checks your geolocation (to check if you’ve left your home or not) and which sends you notifications at random time since around 10AM till around 9PM and you have to take and send a selfie using this app to prove that you didn’t leave your phone and go somewhere, and if you don’t do this within about an hour, you get a 4000 rubles fine (about $60), and a lot of people are fucking pissed because one of the symptoms of the virus is increased fatigue and drowsiness and the people who have the virus basically have to be constantly scared of sleeping during the day, missing the notification and getting the fine, and now a lot of people have to waste their time appealing against these stupid fines) and because of the ongoing voting procedure, which is fucking weird, which is apparently planned as a referendum but it doesn’t follow the correct protocol and which and which isn’t even being referred to as a fucking referendum (it’s called “federal voting about amending the constitution”, they legit don’t ever use the word “referendum”, holy shit!) and which basically rapes the constitution and the country, making it about as authoritarian as it gets, granting Putin... ahem, *the president* with even more power even after! he stops being president, because he’ll literally be a member of the Federal Council for life, with the right to put up to seven people in the Council also for life, and have the right to vote (as a member of the council, which of course will vote 100% the same as Putin votes lmao) for declaring martial law, taking down the president, and to take down/put in place heads of the General Prosecution Office, the Constitutional Court and shit"

2020-06-25 22:00:21,GreatRolmops,"That source you mention, gives the private consumption as percentage of GDP. Private consumption is only the value of consumption by private households. It isn't the only internal source that contributes to a country's GDP. In China's case for example, a relatively large (when compared to the US) proportion of the GDP consists of domestic savings rather than consumption. I worded my statement poorly. What I meant is that roughly about 80% of China's GDP is created by domestic sources, not necessarily  just private consumption. Check out the World Bank's website, they maintain a massive database with just about any statistic imaginable on any country's economy.

And given how central the Chinese economy has become to the world economy in the past two decades, if China's bank loan bubble pops it will be devastating not for just China, but for the entire world, similar to the 2007-2008 crisis which was caused by a similar bubble in the US."

2020-06-25 18:51:27,GreatRolmops,"Again, money isn't a finite supply, it isn't a zero-sum game. It is not like the only way to get more wealth into an economy is by taking it away from other economies. It is possible to generate wealth (that is value) from nothing. If a company designs a new product that people then buy, new wealth is generated. If a company finds a new market for an existing product, then new wealth is generated. If a company takes raw resources and turns them into a product more valuable than the sum of its parts, new wealth is generated. And then governments and banks can just print more money to keep up with the increased demand.

To illustrate this: imagine a restaurant. How does a restaurant contribute to an economy? It takes raw resources (agricultural produce) and labor and then turns these into tasty meals for people to consume. The meal is worth more than the sum of its parts, and so new wealth has been created and the GDP of the country increases."

2020-06-25 17:59:55,Langernama,"#Michel Barnier: The moment of truth about the deal with Britain comes in October

The “moment of truth” for a trade deal between Britain and the European Union will come in October, when the bloc’s 27 leaders will hold a summit and want to see a draft agreement, said EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.

This will give the parties time to ratify any agreement before the end of the transition period for Britain at the end of the year, Barnier said at a video conference at the European Political Center in Brussels on Wednesday.

Although there has been little progress in the negotiations, Barnier said an agreement could still be reached, but warned that the UK would have to honor the commitments it made in a political declaration from last year’s Brexit deal.

“We need clear signals now, what Britain intends to do”, said Michel Barnier ahead of another round of talks that begins on Monday. “If we receive signals next week and make progress in July, even better – but it will mean progress on all topics”, added he.

The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson said that he saw no reason why a deal could not be reached in July and did not want the talks to continue after the summer. London has rejected EU demands for the same fishing rights it enjoys today and for a level playing field that would uphold Britain in line with some of the bloc’s rules.

Barnier said the ball was already “in the UK field”, but both sides would have to compromise."

2020-06-25 17:22:33,Teddyismydawg,"more than happy to answer, an easy example is that people born in very rural rural areas have much lower access to education. the people born in these areas often have to move to boarding school locations for what would be the US equivalent of high school and don’t always have access or monetary means to acquire transportation. also, generally speaking people in rural areas of China don’t have the level of educational attainment that people in cities do. 

ex: ~1/3rd of Chinese students don’t complete middle school and another 1/3rd of high school students don’t complete their education either.* another thing is access to healthcare, I don’t exactly have statistics on this one and I know coming from a family with a lot of American healthcare workers it’s an issue here as well, but in rural areas in China hospitals and clinician access are even more rare than here. I’d have to dig for some articles on this one, but I know a lot of rural Chinese families have to move to larger cities to gain access to educational and other social programs for their children’s sake. they often don’t so much reap the benefits afforded to larger cities themselves as their children do. additionally, the rate of homelessness in mainland China is almost identical to the US and is actually a little higher than here. that being said, I don’t think we’re doing enough to combat homelessness here either, them being close to us in this manner is a knock on both countries. neither of us has a realistic excuse for it.

fwiw: I was fortunate enough to complete a student ambassadorship to China and Hong Kong as a teen, and used military educational benefits to complete an exchange program in Hong Kong in college. I really loved the people, but even in cities I can’t think of many places where I’ve witnessed such stark and immediate changes in wealth as I have in say Beijing or Shanghai between city blocks (Hong Kong is another animal and while has inequality issues, it never seemed nearly as bad, even compared to the US and requires an entirely different post to discuss). I’m also saying this as someone who has lived very close to or in two major US cities and a couple of more rural areas/small towns.

As the world battles the deadly pandemic, the civil war in Libya is raging more fiercely than it ever did in the last few years. In the heart of the conflict is the so-called Libyan National Army (LNA), led by renegade General KhalifaHaftar. Supported by Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt, France and Russia, the LNA has laid a siege on capital Tripoli that is currently under the control of the Government of National Accord (GNA), recognised by the United Nations and pro-actively supported by Turkey, Qatar and Italy.

After months of dithering, Haftar decided to push inside the capital. A panicked GNA asked help from Turkey and Qatar, both supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood who are a party to the accord. They promptly airlifted Jihadists from Idleb in Syria to prop up the failing GNA Forces. Russia, on the other hand, sent mercenaries and arms to prop up the LNA.

For the initial few weeks in April and May, the GNA found it hard to exert its will even after massive help from Turkish mercenaries and drones. Russian mercenaries and missiles managed to blow several Turkish drones out of the sky. As the tussle turned into a quagmire, President Putin tried to broker a deal, an armistice followed by a power-sharing agreement.However, Haftar had other ideas.

Haftar, in his naivety, believed that it was his leadership, and not the Russian help, that had the GNA cornered. He decided not only to reject the deal but also went on to unilaterally declare himself the “leader” of entire Libya.

Russia signalled its mercenaries to pull back. And within a week, the GNA had Haftar and his army on the run. Not only was the siege on Tripoli lifted, but the GNA Forces also became emboldened enough to lay siege to Sirte, an LNA bastion. When Putin realised that Haftarhas learnt his lessons, the mercenaries and missiles were back in action and the GNA soon found itself out of depth.

So, what is it that Russia wants in Libya and how is it planning to achieve those goals?

At this point, sources say, Russia appears to believe that there is no military solution in Libya and all the military posturing must have the end goal to achieve a political and diplomatic breakthrough. This is in some contrast to its strategy in Syria where, although still aspiring for the political solution, it has depended heavily on the military way. In Libya, while it wants the Haftar-led LNA to achieve some military victories, it does not want the GNA to collapse and disintegrate into dozens of smaller warring factions of militias. This mindset has till now driven Russian military calculations on the ground in Libya.

The military support provided by Russia to Haftar has a more short-term goal as well. Because Haftar is supported by Saudis, UAE, Egypt and Russia, sources say there is a sort of friendly competition between all these countries to increase their geopolitical influence inside the LNA. However, unlike UAE, Saudis and Egypt, Russia doesn’t want the LNA to secure decisive victory and the GNA to collapse. It wants the door to remain open for future reconstruction contracts that it will get once a diplomatic solution is reached between the GNA and the LNA.

Russia, on its part, also believes that General Haftarcannot unite entire Libya and therefore he can only be part of a future solution in Libya but not the solutionitself. Russian support, according to the sources, was under the belief that the LNA shall be strong enough for the GNA to take it seriously for diplomatic negotiations.

Sources also confirm that Russia has provided the Eastern and Southern Libyan government (Eastern-based Parliament) of which the LNA is a part with much-needed cash. There was a massive liquidity crunch because of the fall in oil prices. Russia stepped in to relieve the situation in lieu of a deal that will get Moscow pumping rights in some of the oil wells in the region as well as revival of the agreement that Colonel Gaddafi had with Russia where Russia had the right to a military base (naval) in Libya. The assurances in this regard havebeen provided by the government in the East and sources say that a formal deal has either been signed or will be signed in the weeks to come.

Russia has found Haftar frustrating to manage. By declaring himself the Head of entire Libya, Haftar has technically mounted a coup not only against the GNA but also against his own Eastern-based Parliament. This has made it further difficult for his benefactors such as Egypt and Russia to overtly help him militarily.

Sources have confirmed that under the circumstances, while still militarily supporting Haftar, Russia has started exploring the implementation of its Plan B and Plan C.

The Plan B and Plan C of Russia are unfolding intandem. Plan C is to feel out Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a possible replacement to Haftar, or at least as a parallel force to Haftar. This is being done by Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner Group himself. Sources say that contact has been established at this point with no further development.

However, Plan B is in full swing. Russia wants the Eastern-based Parliament in Tabrouk under Saleh Issaand Abdullah al-Thani, the head of the Interim Government in the East, to join ranks to sideline Haftar. This is a very interesting move. First of all, unlike Haftar, both Thani and Saleh are in Russia’s good books and exclusively under its influence. While Russia has to jostle with Saudi, UAE and Egypt for influence over Haftar, in the case of Saleh and Thani, it is miles ahead of the others. Russia wants these two individuals and the institution they represent to start a peace talk with the GNA bypassing Haftar. This will not only clip the wings of Haftar but will also give strength to the Eastern-based Parliament and the Interim Government in the East to exert its dominance over the military wing led by Haftar. This entire file is being overseen by a Russian interlocutor named Stanislav Kudryashov. This guy has excellent relationships with both Thani and Saleh and is the primary brain behind Plan B.

Despite supporting opposing sides in Libya, Turkey and Russia are cooperating behind the scene on several issues. Russia has a line of negotiation opened with the GNA as well, particularly Interior Minister FathiBashagha. This file is being overseen by a Russian individual named Lev Dengov. The Russian-Turkish cooperation in this theatre is to manage the situation where, while the LNA remains a force to reckon with, in the event of any future peace accord, the government must secure Turkish interest including the Demarcation Accord in the Mediterranean struck between Turkey and the GNA.

Sources say that negotiations are taking place between Turkey and Russia that ensures the Demarcation Accord in the Mediterranean holds and, in lieu, Russia is awarded the contract to build the Benghazi-Sirte railway route. The contract is expected to be to the tune of over $3 billion. While this quid-pro-quo deal is still very far from being a reality, it is being discussed. And once again, Turkey and Russia appear to have found some common ground to talk about.

Turkey is very keen that Russia is on board over stopping any division of Libya. While Egypt, UAE and Saudis have no qualms if Libya is divided, Russia and Turkey don’t want this situation. They have their separate motives, however. While for Russia, this will mean that its dream of a naval base is gone as that area will fall into the GNA’s area of operation, Turkey’s own Demarcation Accord in the Mediterranean will become invalid as that line of demarcation will fall under the LNA’s side. Therefore, it is in the interest of both Turkey and Russia to not let Libya get divided.

Whatever be the results of all these manoeuvrings, there’s at least one thing that has been made sure. This is probably the only global conflict in the last 100 years where western powers are not in the driving seat. And that is not due to a lack of will but because they have been muscled out."

Im not the greatest economist so if it seems simple and I missed it I'm sorry but the money flows from companies--&gt;workers--&gt;government--&gt;state employees/any public expense in parallele with straight up company--&gt; government. It's a closed economy inward while outward citizens are free to buy stuff internationally which brings currency outside the country. Service economies work because companies usually go international and ultimately bring profits made in other countries to their home country which will then be taxed. So in our situation seeing as there's a growing ""avoid china"" tendency the number of things they can export will be shrinking won't it? And if it shrunk too much, while the money flowing outward of the country stays the same or grows because of a growing middle class being able to afford better good, isint that bad for the country?"

&gt; 2 min read. MOSCOW - Polls opened in Russia on Thursday for a week-long vote on constitutional changes that would allow President Vladimir Putin to stay in power until 2036.

&gt; Holding the vote in the middle of a pandemic has elicited public health concerns, because Russia is still reporting over 7,000 new virus cases daily and has 606,000 confirmed infections in all, the third-worst caseload in the world.

&gt; The Kremlin has repeatedly dismissed these concerns, saying that Russia was able to slow down the epidemic and assuring people that all necessary measures have been to ensure the safety of the voters.

We could end up with another imperial japan where the citizens could eventually think that they're culture and country is the pinnacle of civilization and everyone else is lesser than. With enough brainwashing there could be an entire generation of Chinese in power in their government that want to ""share their culture, ideals, and prosperity"" hence the whole history is doomed to repeat itself quote especially if said history is altered or never taught. 
I mean hell imagine a large population of people (not everyone just a majority) that was never taught the horrors and lessons of the holocaust who are also taught to revere a man who indirectly murdered millions.

Service based economy targeting inside markets  won't bring in any new currency in the country, and since they are doing  everything in their power to lose their international reputation, it  doesn't seem like they are such a hotspot of investing especially since  corona. 

You don't need trade and foreign investment to bring in new money. Money isn't finite, economy isn't a zero-sum game (meaning you can generate wealth without it coming at the expense of someone else). What matters most for the Chinese (or the US or any other country relying primarily on an internal service market) government is that a service economy does bring a lot of money into the government's coffers through taxation. People work and get paid a salary. The government taxes this and gets a cut of the salary. People then spend this money on groceries, luxury goods and services. The government taxes all of those transactions. The companies who provide those goods and services make a profit. The government taxes that profit. The companies use their profits to pay their workers (taxes!) and to develop and deliver new goods and services and thus generate even more profits (more taxes!). And if you have a massive population and many companies, the government's revenue from taxes will also be absolutely massive."

You may want to actually look up what a concentration camp is...because we most definitely have them in the southern US:

con·cen·tra·tion camp

/ˌkänsənˈtrāSHən ˈˌkamp/

noun: concentration camp; plural noun: concentration camps

**a place where large numbers of** people, especially political prisoners or members of **persecuted minorities, are deliberately imprisoned in a relatively small area with inadequate facilities**, sometimes to provide forced labor or to await mass execution.

Just because we stop short of the last qualifiers of **sometimes** forcing labor or executing people...does not mean that we don't have concerntration camps in the US.

2020-06-25 13:24:39,OrganicMemer,USA bad? What an original opinion to have on reddit. Color me surprised.
2020-06-25 13:18:45,gxs007_2,"Most of us (Indians) still pride ourselves in our diversity, secularism and inclusivity. 

But there are many complex reasons why even a diverse multicultural country might side with Modi, the following are some that I can think of:

1.	A small percent of far right individuals exist in each country, similar to Qanon believers in the US. Unfortunately these are the most vocal. 
2.	INC is the party of Nehru and Gandhi and did ride the freedom wave for a substantial portion of India’s history. They did some good things, some bad and people just wanted a change. The only other option was BJP. 
3.	People vote differently in state and central elections.  Although India has a multitude of regional parties and the diversity in state governments does show that to some extent, when it comes to the Center, only two parties are feasible contenders, INC and BJP. If you look at the curious case of AAP, they ran on socialist reforms like free healthcare and better free education( both areas where they did a commendable job) AAP won the Delhi state elections but lost miserably in central elections. 
4.	Some issues are so important to some people that they turn a blind eye to everyone thing. The most prominent of these issues are Pakistan and Ram Janmabhoomi(not stepping in that minefield, google it yourself)
5.	When Modi won in 2014, congress was had been ruling since a long time and many senior ministers got caught up in a of financial scandals. After winning the 2014 election BJP did all it could to make sure it won every following election. They were swimming in money, they set up troll farms and IT cells. Massive disinformation campaigns. Similar to what the Republican Party does in the US. 
6.	They did some good work which was enough for some people to overlook everything else
7.	Competition from INC is non existent because their main guy is , well, ummm, different. 

So no, India is having a bit of a rough patch( not the first) like US et all but in the long term I have complete faith in fellow Indians to move this country in the right direction as it has been for the past 7 decades."

2020-06-25 12:56:00,dekachin5,"&gt;Japanese internment camps in WW2? Mexican internment camps right now?

- The internment wasn't even that big of a deal. It's only seen as bad through the lens of modern politics. The US had a valid reason to require that ethnic Japanese stay away from the west coast at a time when Americans feared sabotage and attacks from Japan. The internees were well treated and free to leave at any time as long as they had somewhere to go outside the exclusion zone.

- ""Mexican internment camps"" are actually just jails housing illegal immigrants (not just Mexicans) pending deportation. There is nothing improper with the US enforcing its immigration laws. Again, they are well treated and given rights/due process.

- Chinese Communist mass-incarceration prisons in Xinjiang, on the other hand, are a [genocidal parade of horrors](https://note.com/tomomishimizu/n/n3e98fa71dc4e), where the CCP rapes and tortures millions for the crime of being from a non-Han ethnic minority in territory that is not historically Chinese but that the CCP wants to cement its hold on. It's genuine orwellian horror by which the CCP seeks to break an entire people in mind and body, crushing them for no better reason than to undermine any effort by these very distinct people to obtain autonomy should the CCP suffer a loss of power down the road. It's not like the land or country has any great strategic value or resources, either, it's just that the CCP is desperate to grab any land it can in service of its imperial ambitions."

*****
&gt; Atheists and humanists are facing discrimination and persecution in some countries because of their beliefs and values, according to a new report.

&gt; Non-religious people in Colombia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines and Sri Lanka are often ostracised, and some women are forced into marriages, says Humanists At Risk: Action Report 2020, published on Thursday by Humanists International.

&gt; Gary McLelland, the chief executive of Humanists International, said: &amp;quot;This report shines a light on the targeted violence, continued harassment and social discrimination faced by humanists in many countries and opens the door to conversations on how best to protect humanists worldwide. What is clear is that all laws and policies which criminalise &amp;#039;blasphemy&amp;#039; should be repealed.""

2020-06-25 10:44:34,Not-Jessica,"First off, thank you for that. Part of it was just plain funny. 

But I will point out that a peer-reviewed journal is not automatically a journal of quality. In fact, the authors of this hoax planned a rerun with journals of better repute just to address this particular critique. (I’m not sure what the outcome of this was; if I remember correctly, some of them got in trouble with their universities for fraudulently representing some colleagues to get past reviewers.)

I won’t argue that the entire hoax was pointless for this reason. Of course it speaks to the need for more rigour in academic publications in the social sciences. But I will keep going back to the claim that you originally made, that results are actively suppressed when they’re deemed undesirable by their authors. You still haven’t addressed it at all, and I doubt that you can or will. If the authors of his hoax had done solid research that supported “inconvenient” conclusions and then had been refused by journals for this, then that would have supported your original claim. 

Some journals on the lower end of clout and repute accepted sub-par papers. The authors of those hoax papers acknowledged this critique by aiming for journals of better quality. None of that proves that the academia is conspiring to not publish ‘inconvenient’ results from actually robust studies for ideological reasons. 

I’m not up for deconstructing every article or study you find tangentially related to your original claim. Unless you‘re trying to address your specific accusation that good quality studies or articles aren’t published because of ideological reasons, I can’t respond anymore."

&gt; Recent Chinese boycotts have targeted things like Australian beef or Houston Rockets games, but not more vital commodities.

&gt; Today China prefers to use its coastguard, its maritime militia and other agencies to bully neighbours. 

&gt; Daryl Morey of the Houston Rockets, when he retweeted the slogan: “Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong”, in support of anti-government protests in that territory.

Service based economy targeting inside markets won't bring in any new currency in the country, and since they are doing everything in their power to lose their international reputation, it doesn't seem like they are such a hotspot of investing especially since corona.

Now they could counter that by exporting stuff they have a monopoly on like the current situation with rare minerals, but natural ressources always have a cap and ultimately technology is the best bet. Technology, which they have famously started acquiring through national commercial spy agencies further damaging their reputation. Not even at the sweatshop level, companies manufacturing more complex goods don't want to go to china since they will inevitably get their secrets stolen (see the Norton case and many others). While it used to be silent from the rest of the world, it's starting to change with stories like Australia calling them out on it only for China to try and flex muscle, FURTHER DESTROYING THEIR REPUTATION. 

Couple that with the economic bubble the CCP has led china into, economic isolation will be the last nail in the coffin of the CCP. At least they will have coffins because while you mention that grown middle class, do remember it's not that sweet. Elders across china are turning to suicide because of the sheer number of that demographic. While they would traditionally be supported by their children's until their passing, the fact that the age demographic pyramid in china has heavily shifted toward the elders because of the one child policy has lead to situations where people literally go in the wild to die and not be a burden to their children (funeral treatment are a luxury in some parts of china because of the number of elders dying and space being limited.). But that's not all, because those who do not go down that path are an even greater drag down the CCP. In recent years, China has tried in every way possible to legally bring traditional Chinese medicine (ex:ginger soup will cure all your ills) as the same status as modern medicine, because paying universal modern healthcare for such a huge populations and an ever aging population is impossible and they know it.

All this has led to a very fragile status quo which pushed the CCP to crack down HARD on anything that could go break it (hong kong for instance). So while we are used to hearing stuff like: The Chinese bubble will collapse soon etc, I do believe that what happened with civil unrest in 2019 followed by the largest global pandemic in a century bred in that country, has undoubtedly shown to us that it WILL happen.

2020-06-25 06:12:05,GreatRolmops,"Actually, it is mostly those prices why the capitalists are moving their production out of China. China has changed a lot over the past 20 years. It is no longer a poor, developing country. But as China develops and standards of living there increase, so do the salaries that the capitalists need to pay and therefore the costs of producing there.

This means that since China has gotten expensive the capitalists are now starting to move on to cheaper countries with lower salaries and standards of living (like Vietnam, India or Bangladesh).

To China however, this is no longer a concern. Because China has developed so much, it now has a large, moderately wealthy middle class and a very wealthy upper class that constitute a massive internal market. This means that China has shifted from becoming a country whose economy is focused on manufacturing, export and international trade to a country whose economy (like that of the US) is focused on fulfilling the demands of the internal market. In other words, China went from being reliant on selling stuff to other countries to being reliant on selling stuff to its own people.

This means that China no longer has to be so careful about its reputation. Like the US, they can now afford to take off the kid gloves and bully and upset other countries in pursuit of their interests without having to fear that this will ruin their trade and economy."

2020-06-25 06:04:48,randomnighmare,This is pretty much what China thinks currently. They don't care and they know that nothing will be done about it because they are the world's factory. Not only that but I am sure that China has a plan B just in case sanctions do happen. But they literally think they can get away with all of this.

2020-06-25 05:58:27,GreatRolmops,"China does not rely on trade with other countries to stay afloat. That maybe was so in the 1990's and early 2000's, but that time is long past. Present-day China has the largest single market of any country in the world (only the EU is larger but that is not a single country). All countries depend partially on trade for their economy, but Chinese companies are probably literally the least reliant on foreign trade compared to companies from anywhere else in the world. Foreign trade only generates about 20% of China's GDP (according to the World Bank). Compare this with countries like Germany (47%) or South Korea (43%) that are much more reliant on the international economy.

China definitely has weaknesses, but the economy is not one of them. It is in fact probably the biggest strength of China."

2020-06-25 05:52:40,MiG-25,"There used to be a bigger system in the 80s called the Iron Rice bowl, basically the state took care of you from birth to death. 

Nowadays there's a 2 tier plan, a basic and employee contribution part. The basic one is based off province wide average wages and prices. This is interesting because what one worker in a rural province gets paid could be miles away from what someone in Beijing gets. Regardless, the basic pension is typically extremely low and not nearly enough to actually retire off of. This leaves the defined contribution plan, in which employees contribute 8% and employers contribute 20%. 

What's interesting is that the retirement age is 60 for men and 55 for women, with some circumstances allowing it to go down to 55 and 50 (there must however be at least 15 years of contribution). This is quite lower than many other country's retirement ages and probably won't be sustainable in the future."

They can also try to do what Russia and Singapore do and provide monetary benefits for people to have babies. China's problem comes from the fact that they have a ton of people with a ton of babies, and then suddenly the number of babies stopped while life expectancy rose by 20 something years. So you end up with old people who are living longer with lower amounts of young people to support them, similar to what we have with Social Security but on a China-size scale."

Sociology does not just make stuff up, it is based observation and statistical analysis.

Also, surveys and polls is how advertising and marketers collect data. That’s aren’t any huge labs with white walls where they isolate people and stick electrodes in their brains to get their response. They just ask people what they feel about a product.

&gt;	For example, objectification is literally just an opinion with no backing whatsoever. There is no evidence sexy women in media makes men treat women worse.

“Sexy women exist in media” is not objectification, dumbass. It’s not only a part of gender studies but also media studies.

Objectification is when characters, in most cases female, are not ascribed agency within a piece of media and are treated somewhat like robots and only exist as either a love interest or a plot device. This then affects the psyche of young men who consume this media (surely you’re not a complete imbecile who doesn’t think that media has any affect on people). 

r/NiceGuys is full of examples of guys who have been affected by this trope, these dudes believe that women are incapable of making choices for themselves and believe that if they input niceness into women, sex should pop out. That is what objectification is, not “sexy women exist”.

This just shows how ignorant you are. One day your thought-daddy came out and said “gender studies bad” and you were just like “yeah that feels right”. 

You don’t know the first thing about science and data collection and interpretation."

2020-06-24 23:11:26,rtechie1,"&gt;&gt;	There is very little within gender studies that is based on credible scientific experiments, as opposed to surveys or opinion polls.
&gt;
&gt;Surveys and polls are in fact valid and credible scientific experiments and fall under the category of natural and field experiments (as opposed to controlled experiments) and utilise multivariable analyses (rather than isolating a given variable as done in lab experiments) to make and test predictions.

I'm not getting into this debate. If you can't admit that type of research is inferior to controlled experiments we're done. 

&gt;This is because it would be virtually impossible as well as excessively expensive to perform said experiments in a controlled environment.

Tough. Particle colliders cost a ton of money but physicists don't just make up stuff. This is a really lame excuse. 

&gt;You can’t just take a thousand babies and feed some of them a different diet for 80 years to see how many on that diet have good hearts.

Why not? Because it's *hard*? Yeah, science can be difficult. It's better for a scientist to spend their entire life generating one fact then to spew out endless papers of poorly researched nonsense. 

&gt;Gender studies, like all social sciences are concerned with how people affect the society they are in and how people are effected by the society in which they live, therefore, the best method of data collection for these sciences is going out and asking people what they think about a certain subject. This is very similar to how experiments are conducted in fields like economics.

Opinion surveys aren't science. Is political polling science? What's the difference? 

&gt;Hypotheses and theories made by social-sciences are both testable and repeatable and are employed in fields like Advertising, Marketing, and Human Resource Management. 

Yes, advertising has spent many decades and spent billions on **controlled experiments** to establish facts about persuasion. Such that we understand the science of persuasion pretty well. That's exactly how psychology should work. 

However stuff like Meyers-Briggs, popular in HR, are garbage. 

&gt;You could, if you wanted, go out and test the hypotheses made by gender-studies scholars and get the same results.

They literally just make things up. How could I get the same results? 

For example, objectification is literally just an opinion with no backing whatsoever. There is no evidence sexy women in media makes men treat women worse."

Stop being so pedantic. They arrested and threatened the man for the crime of telling people about an imminent pandemic. He saved lives. They punished him for it. Awfully cunty behavior if you ask me.

China, meanwhile, killed people. They let sick folks get planes knowing they were sick. They cornered the market for PPE. They destroyed lab results, hid the extent of the contagion, and refused to share early data on the virus. It's hard to imagine how they could have fucked over the world any harder than they already did. Basically, cunts."
2020-06-24 22:51:12,rtechie1,"&gt;If you’re a strict positivist and criticise gender studies for its methods, I’ll assume you don’t consider anthropology, history, sociology, psychology, philosophy, economics, law, or cultural studies as real science either.

Philosophy is based on logical arguments, evidence and bad research aren't really a concern. Philosophy does not claim to be science. 

History, economics, law, and cultural studies do not claim to be science. 

But anthropology, sociology, and psychology DO claim to be science. They are ""soft"" sciences and generate huge amounts of bad data. They are not on the same level as ""hard"" sciences like physics. 

&gt;And in that case you’re just taking a side in a debate that’s gone on for decades if not centuries already in academia. 

You'd be right. As an engineer and computer scientist you can guess which side I'm on. 

&gt;And it’s not a particularly worthwhile discussion to be honest, because we do need other professions besides physicists, chemists, and engineers.

Sure, for example, psychologists are basically priests and priests certainly have a social function. So do strippers. I don't claim strippers are scientists."

2020-06-24 19:47:30,burtzev,"So basically Portugal is saying ""no deal until you straighten out"". Sounds like a long wait. The history of these restrictions, especially in the USA, can be described as ""wild"". The US restriction on travel from Europe originally exempted Ireland and the UK. In a few days the sane people in Washington managed to get through the fog in the brain of you-know-who and point out that you can't exempt countries just because you have golf courses there. Ireland and the UK were added.

More seriously you-know-who has twice tried to destroy the US agriculture industry by banning farm workers from Mexico, which  still has far less of a problem than the USA does. Well, you can imagine the phone calls and emails to the DOA. This was also walked back - twice. No doubt he'll try again. 

My favourite was the ""US troops on the Canadian border"" scheme to prevent the hordes of illegals trying to sneak into Plague Central from another country with a far better coronavirus record. It didn't go over well. That was also walked back. Perhaps Canada threatened to mobilize their massive army of beavers, loons and moose to jump on their snowmobiles and put an end to the Washington Regime. White House burning #2 ?"

You would not, actually, and that is what the data shows: broadcast news - which is seen as less partisan - has higher scores.

&gt; A 13-year-old girl from the neighborhood where the plane went down was critically injured in the crash and later died in hospital.

&gt; The crash took place when the plane attempted to land for the second time.

[Negative. They realized they were fucked in ww2 if they didn't keep trading with the nazis, so they just kept doing so under the guise  We aRe NeUtRaL and we don't want to be invaded](http://www.historyisnowmagazine.com/blog/2016/2/14/was-switzerland-neutral-or-a-nazi-ally-in-world-war-two#.XvNV9GkpCDY=)

&gt;Prior to WWII, Switzerland had relied heavily on trade with Germany to build a strong and economically powerful nation. It was an industrialized country with virtually no raw materials, experiencing the same economic depression that was felt throughout both Europe and America. When World War Two commenced, Switzerland worried that any non-cooperation would lead to a cease in vital trade and even more significantly, an invasion. As it was completely surrounded by Nazi controlled countries, the Swiss had two choices: cooperate with Nazi trade policies or fight against them.
Between the years of 1939 and 1945, roughly 10,276,000 tons of coal was transported from Germany to Switzerland and provided 41% of Switzerland’s energy requirement. This demonstrates how the Swiss were keen to stay on good terms with Germany to continue their vital trade.
One thing Switzerland provided to the Nazis in return for important materials was access to the railway that ran through Switzerland and connected Italy and Germany. In the event of an invasion, the Swiss army planned to destroy vital tunnels and bridges, immobilizing the railway for years and making transportation between Italy and Germany nearly impossible. To uphold their neutral stand, Switzerland’s governments laid down restrictions on what could be transported over their railway. The Swiss would only allow sealed boxes to pass through without checking their contents, in exchange for raw materials and trade. Officially, the Swiss banned any transportation of people (troops) or war goods over their railway, but the extent to which this was upheld is very questionable."

2020-06-24 15:30:07,lapse_of_taste,"&gt;purely normative? like ""human rights are good""? no. 

Political philosophy uses arguments, not just assertions, and that's historically where important debates took place. Like, the political ideologies that shape the world were debated in formal academic settings for millenia, and now we have to throw them out because you think writing on normative issues is...immature? Dangerous? Dishonorable? A waste of time?

The debate between libertarians and social democrats needs to take place somewhere, whether that's (preferably) an academic setting or a Youtube comment thread.

&gt;""we hypothesize that an increase of human rights as defined by powers et al. has a benefit on quality of life. to test this, we take markers of quality of life in 40 countries and estimate the correlation with the human right index as presented by müller et al. we find that..."" 

And quality of life is not a normative criterion? The problem with your suggestion is that either you are sneaking a normative standard in through the backdoor, or you are just going to present a meaningless correlation between variables no one cares about.

In fact, if you want to cleanse academia from normativity, you'd need to throw out large chunks of psychology and medicine too. It may be uncontroversial to think that depression is bad, but to say that there is no moral reasoning motivating research would be false. 

&gt;in mathematics, imo, its always worth it to research. mostly because sooo many applications pop up, often unexpected.

Can we generalize that sentiment to other academic fields? Or do you think that we should throw out Babylonian history because it's the study of a dead culture?"

&gt;corona is not a lab-grown / artificial virus.

Nobody ever said it was. That is a straw man.

The problem is when you create the very monster you were trying to prevent, and then unleash it on the world.

&gt;And it's not the first virus either that has managed the jump from bats and other animal reservoirs, look up ""zoonosis"".

There is no evidence at this point that COVID jumped from bats to humans out in the wild. There is considerable evidence that transmission arose from Wuhan labs studying coronaviruses.

&gt;On Sept. 15 — in a shockingly quick implosion — Iceland’s government collapsed, again. This is the third male-led center-right government in a row to lose the confidence of the Icelandic population before serving out its full term.

&gt;Why do Icelanders keep electing these coalitions that keep collapsing?
&gt;Iceland is a microstate of some 300,000, in which outrage reverberates quickly through the Internet echo chamber. Despite having an elected president with some policymaking authority, Iceland is mostly a parliamentary democracy where coalition governments are common. In recent cycles, the multiparty system has included several new parties, such as the Pirate Party, which have shaken up the system. Put these together and it explains the new volatility within Iceland’s system. But it doesn’t account for the repeated implosion of male-led, right-leaning governments.

At the time of this comment, my comment you replied to is at -8. The CCP shills are out in force tonight.

If you aren't aware of the extensive evidence in favor of the lab release theory, which is at this point the dominant theory, you simply haven't been paying attention.

[Here is one link with some evidence and explanation.](https://www.independentsciencenews.org/health/the-case-is-building-that-covid-19-had-a-lab-origin/) 

A lot of the stupidity in the media supposedly ""debunking"" that the CCP ""created"" the virus in a lab comes from the fact that you can't put together a virus in a lab like it's made of LEGOs. The COVID virus evolved from a natural virus, obviously. Thing is, the Wuhan labs were conducting ""gain of function"" research where the lab researchers were purposely evolving the virus to infect humans so that they could study what a human-infectious coronavirus would look like so they could better fight it if it emerged naturally. This is all well and good, until the virus escaped thanks to negligent containment procedures. The scientists created the very monster they were trying to prevent, and then negligently unleashed it onto humanity.

The Chinese Communist Party, of course, is working overtime to stack the deck against this theory, so there are countless MSM articles claiming it can't be true (without evidence). The fact that Trump and Pompeo came out in favor of it means all the anti-Trump liberals in the media are reflexively against it.

Bret Weinstein - a biologist - was recently on the Joe Rogan podcast where [he explained why the lab release theory is by far the most likely explanation.](https://youtu.be/pRCzZp1J0v0?t=6881)"

1. Thanks for going through my post history. There is a lot of great stuff in there, you could learn a lot. I advise everyone to read through all of it.

2. I did indeed state that I suspect that communist agitator Martin Gugino chose to fall backwards to exaggerate his injuries to martyr himself. The video clearly shows he turned to the side as he began to stumble backwards, as is normal for people, and then twisted himself to fall straight backwards without putting his arms out to break his fall. His online social media and blogs show a 20 year history of hard left activism. The man is 75 and knew this was his last hurrah.

&gt; The reversal on China’s part comes after over 120 countries said they’d like to see an independent investigation into where the virus came from and how it started its initial spread in China.

2020-06-24 10:29:39,VrijeRepubliekTwente,"#EU pushing ahead with digital tax despite US resistance, Vestager says
Brussels would ‘really, really prefer a global consensus,’ but will go it alone ‘if we need to,’ top Commission official says.

The European Union’s powerful antitrust and COVID-19 bailout enforcer says the EU will push ahead with its own digital services tax even if the U.S. sticks to its efforts to block a global deal. European Commission Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager, from Denmark, is the most senior EU official to speak out in the wake of the U.S. withdrawing from negotiations on the tax.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin withdrew June 17 from talks brokered by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which aimed to create a global system for taxing digital services in the country where each transaction takes place — at a rate of at least 2 percent — rather than where the tech company is headquartered.

Vestager’s strong language on the collapsing tax negotiations as well as the broader transatlantic relationship signal the EU is increasingly willing to operate with its elbows out when dealing with the United States, and has all but given up negotiating with the Trump administration.

In a wide-ranging virtual interview, Vestager said the EU would “really, really prefer a global consensus” on digital tax, but will push ahead with a regional tax, “if we need to.”

The new tax is necessary, Vestager argued, due to the ease with which many large tech companies minimize their European taxes. That makes it “so difficult to defend the many, many, many businesses all over the world who pay their taxes,” she said. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told the French Senate this month that the U.S. was the lone holdout on a deal: “We were a few inches from an agreement,” he told local radio.

A frustrated Vestager said that big tech companies are inviting a backlash from both consumers and regulators by repeatedly pushing the limits of EU law. Many of those companies are American, Vestager highlighted, pointing to a long list of antitrust and tax cases against Apple, Amazon and Google as a sign companies are not learning from past EU regulatory tangles.

“I worry that we did not have one Google case: We had two, we had three. We've had one Amazon case, (and) now we have a new one. And we unfortunately had to open (two cases) on Apple.” She added, archly, “There is, I think, still a learning potential.”

U.S. President Donald Trump has previously labeled Vestager the “tax lady” over her decision to force Apple to pay over $14 billion in unpaid taxes to the government of Ireland.

Vestager’s tough line on foreign tech companies operating in Europe is part of her broader goal for “open strategic autonomy,” she said, where the continent pushes back against more aggressive U.S. and Chinese policy postures, maintains open markets, and defends Europe’s “welfare states, universal health care, universal access to education.”

But Vestager also expressed concern that despite shared “fundamental values,” the U.S. and EU are allowing themselves to be divided by China, with severe economic and political consequences.

Vestager said some Chinese companies do not compete “fair and square” and said “there is a huge problem of reciprocity” when it comes to market access in China. EU officials are frustrated that Chinese authorities block foreign companies from bidding for Chinese government projects, while suspecting that Chinese companies benefit from government subsidies, giving them an unfair advantage in the EU’s more open public tender systems.

The frustrations found concrete form last week when the European Commission supported the creation of a legal tool that would allow Brussels to crack down against foreign subsidies, including by blocking acquisitions or banning companies from participating in public tenders.

Vestager hinted that she would not be afraid to use the EU’s new powers once they are finalized. “Where I grew up in the Western part of Denmark, if you invite people over and they don't invite you back, eventually you stop” inviting them, she said.

Another possible solution, she said, would be a joint U.S.-EU “Trade and Technology Council,"" an idea first proposed by the EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan to give Western powers a place to coordinate their position vis-a-vis Chinese technology and commerce. “Right now we are not making best use” of our “shared values and having a common history,” she said.

Vestager conceded, however, that “China is a partner, for instance, on climate change,” and can’t simply be cut loose.

That has complicated the EU's response on issues like human rights in Hong Kong, where the continent has struggled to move from words to action. Joshua Wong, a leader of anti-Beijing protests in Hong Kong, last week accused the EU of running an “appeasement policy” on Hong Kong, to safeguard its economic interests in China. Vestager acknowledged Wong has reason to be frustrated with the EU — “he's in a very difficult situation.”

In the wake of the economic devastation wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic, Vestager has been put in charge of ensuring economic rescue packages passed by governments within the bloc do not unduly distort markets. And she reiterated Tuesday that she is enforcing strict rules on those who receive bailout money.

Conditions on those rescue funds include a “ban of bonuses of senior management, acquisition bans, dividend bans,"" she said, adding that government support must only be offered with clear “sunset clauses.”

Vestager also noted the EU attaches more stringent conditions to using government money to recapitalize or restructure a company than it attaches to short-term offers of liquidity support.

Businesses that were failing before the pandemic will not be allowed to take government money to camouflage their existing weaknesses, she added."

2020-06-24 10:06:16,ErnestLi,Fun fact China voted agreement in the United Nations investigation proposal that was proposed by the European Union weeks before Australia did. Australia only voted after 122 countries voted that includes most developed and developing countries in the Americas Europe Asia Africa and your New Zealand neigh. As of now the only nation that oppose it(voted against said investigation) is the United States of America who exited the WHO.  Unfortunately your news doesn’t report things like that and still pretends that China didn’t vote in favour of an EU lead international investigation weeks before Australia.

**STATEMENT BY THE G-77 AND CHINA IN SUPPORT OF THE WHO IN THE FIGHT AGAINST COVID-19**"

2020-06-24 09:33:00,DCFY7439,"The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump introduced a long-awaited U.N. Security Council (UNSC) draft resolution extending an arms embargo on Iran that is due to expire in October, setting the stage for a great-power clash and likely veto in the U.N.’s principal security body, according to a copy of the draft obtained by Foreign Policy.

The U.S. draft resolution would oblige nations, including the United States, to take active measures to prevent Iran from supplying, selling, or transferring arms to other countries, unless the Security Council committee overseeing U.N. sanctions approves such transfers. The measure would also require all U.N. member states to inspect cargo transiting through their territory to check for illicit arms imports or exports from Iran, and grant them authority to seize and destroy such weapons.

It would also impose an asset freeze and travel ban on individuals responsible for violating the arms embargo, and authorize states to “seize, inspect, freeze (impound), confiscate, and dispose of any vessel in their ports.” In an effort to ratchet up pressure on Iran, the resolution would request that U.N. Secretary General António Guterres report any attacks by armed groups that threaten regional stability or interference in the freedom of navigation in the region. The resolution would also establish a special council committee to monitor compliance with the sanctions and appoint a panel of eight experts to investigate and compile information on potential violations of the embargo.

If passed, the resolution would fall under Chapter VII of the U.N. charter, making it legally binding and enforceable. But the U.S. measure, according to several U.N. Security Council diplomats, stands little chance of being adopted by the 15-nation council. One council diplomat said that the U.S. initiative might not even receive the minimum threshold of nine votes it needs in the council that would force a veto from one of the permanent Security Council members. “This is not something that they are trying to get through the council,” said the diplomat.

Some council diplomats and other nonproliferation experts see the U.S. move as a way to score political points at home, not to do anything about Iran’s destabilizing activities in the region.

“The skeptic in me says that the objective of this exercise is to go through the arms embargo resolution, and when it fails, to use that as an excuse to get a snapback of the embargo, and if and when that fails too, to use as a political talking point in the election campaign,” said Mark Fitzpatrick, a former State Department nonproliferation official now at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Since China and Russia are almost certain to ignore any U.N. arms embargo forced by U.S. maneuvers, the practical impact on Iran’s ability to cause mischief will be minimal, he said.

“It’s not actually about stopping any arms from China and Russia, it’s about winning a political argument,” he said.

The draft also condemns a string of alleged armed attacks by Iran against the United States, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, including the September 2019 drone and missile attack against two Saudi oil installations and a Dec. 27 strike allegedly by an Iranian-backed militia against an Iraqi military base in Kirkuk province, Iraq, which resulted in the death of a U.S. citizen and injured several U.S. and Iraqi personnel.

The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) envisioned the expiration of a sweeping U.N. arms embargo on Iran after five years if Tehran complied with its obligation to scale back its nuclear activities and subject its program to expanded international monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Iran had largely complied with its obligations until Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement in May 2018 and reintroduced a series of U.S. sanctions against the country. 

Since then, Tehran has violated key tenets of the JCPOA, including enriching uranium to purity levels higher than what is allowed in the deal and increasing the stockpiles of enriched uranium, according to assessments from the International Atomic Energy Agency. 

China and Russia, which wield veto power over Security Council decisions, have signaled their unwillingness to approve the resolution. Other signatories of the Iran deal—Britain, France, and Germany—have all supported retaining arms embargoes on Iran, but they also came out against the Trump administration’s threat to reimpose sanctions, highlighting the sharp disagreements between Washington and its closest European allies over Iran. 

“We firmly believe that any unilateral attempt to trigger UN sanctions snapback would have serious adverse consequences in the UNSC,” the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and Germany said in a statement on June 19. “We would not support such a decision which would be incompatible with our current efforts to preserve the JCPoA.”

The foreign ministers also cautioned that lifting the U.N. conventional arms embargo “would have major implications for regional security and stability” but stressed that even without a U.N. arms embargo, the European Union has its own ban on sending conventional weapons and missile technology to Iran through 2023. Senior U.S. officials have said that Russia and China would be poised to sell conventional arms to Iran if the U.N. embargo expires.

A State Department spokesperson told Foreign Policy that “failing to extend the arms embargo will risk even greater violence in the Middle East.”

The spokesperson added that the U.S. is “hopeful” that the draft resolution will be supported by the Security Council, stating that China and Russia have upheld similar restrictions in the past. “Given that Iran’s activity continues to pose a threat to international peace and security, we do not see any reason why [the] Security Council consensus on this issue should have changed,” the spokesperson said.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo argued on Twitter Tuesday that if the arms embargo expires, Iran would be able to purchase Russian and Chinese jets, allowing Tehran to potentially threaten Europe and Asia, though Pompeo used one-way flight ranges for those aircraft to exaggerate their potential threat.

The Trump administration’s push to reimpose sanctions opened a unique legal debate over the United States’ current standing with the JCPOA. The Trump administration has argued that it is still legally a party to the deal the president disavowed, allowing it to trigger the snapback of sanctions. This argument has angered top diplomats from other countries that were signatories to the deal, who said the United States couldn’t have it both ways.

Brian Hook, the Trump administration’s top Iran envoy, said in an interview with Foreign Policy last month that the president remains open to “sitting down” with Tehran for talks on a new deal. He said that the United States would still maintain its expanding sanctions regime on Iran in the meantime. 

“We’re in no hurry. We have a good policy in place. The regime needs to decide when it wants to come to the table,” he said."

&gt; A timely reminder of Saudi Arabia&amp;#039;s current vulnerability to the continued threat that Iran and its proxies pose it - one of the key threats that the deal with Russia would eliminate, the Kremlin has said - came in the form of the attack on Tuesday 23 June when the Saudi-led military coalition fighting in Yemen intercepted and destroyed eight booby-trapped unmanned aircraft that were targeting civilian objects and civilians in Saudi Arabia.

&gt; Russia&amp;#039;s Energy Minister, Alexander Novak, also flagged at the time that Russia gas producer Novatek was in talks for Saudi investors to take part in its Arctic LNG-2 project, a follow-up to its US$27 billion plant in the Yamal peninsula.

&gt; The upshot for Russia was, firstly, that the Saudis rowed back on their demand that Syria&amp;#039;s President Bashar al-Assad be removed from power and, secondly, that Saudi Arabia signed a memorandum of understanding for the purchase from Russia of its S-400 air defense system.

&gt;The decision aims to “preserve an adequate competitive environment, that ensures the functioning of a payment system that’s interchangeable, fast, secure, transparent, open and cheap,” the monetary authority said in a statement on its website. Bank authorities requested that Mastercard Inc. and Visa Inc. stop payment and money transfer activities through the app.

&gt;A suspension without presenting further arguments is “an unusual, extraordinary move by the central bank, especially in payments arrangements and technology market,” said Tiago Severo Gomes, a partner at Caputo, Bastos and Serra and a specialist in fintechs and banking regulation.

I don't know if an entity as big as Facebook can exist in a competitive market, but IDK what the e-payment landscape of Brazil looks like. Whatsapp hasn't done anything wrong except be owned by Facebook (which should warrant the lash but I'm not in charge), but maybe more details are to follow. 

&gt;“Our goal is to provide digital payments to all WhatsApp users in Brazil using an open model and we will continue to work with local partners and the Central Bank to make this possible,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said. ”In addition, we support the Central Bank’s PIX project on digital payments and together with our partners are committed to work with the Central Bank to integrate our systems when PIX becomes available,” the spokesperson said, referring to Brazil’s proposed instant-payment system.

&gt;The company was surprised by the Central Bank’s decision, and the two sides were in regular contact in the run-up to the payments launch, said a person familiar with the talks who asked not to be named discussing private deliberations.

I'm just paranoid but it sounds like a last-minute shakedown for more money cause of the surprise part of it."

Sex is genetically determined, whether you like that or not.

*****
&gt; SYDNEY - Trust in China among Australians has more than halved amid diplomatic and trade disputes, with only 23% saying they trusted Beijing to act responsibly in the world compared to a 52% reading two years ago, a major poll has found.

&gt; The annual Lowy Institute Poll also found rising support for Australia&amp;#039;s security alliance with the United States, up six points to 78% this year, even though U.S. President Donald Trump was unpopular with Australians.

&gt; While Australians believed the U.S. alliance was important for Australia&amp;#039;s security, Fullilove said &amp;quot;Trust in the United States has stagnated, and few Australians have confidence in President Trump&amp;quot;.

Personally, as a strong supporter of a free and independent press, I think that kind of regulation is very important, so at least one class of bad actors are prevented from having direct surreptitious influence.

&gt;It's money to be spent which boosts the economy and eventually gets back to the EU through a variety of taxes

I'm not so sure about that. It would only be a fraction of the initial amount, and then only after a period of time. 

&gt;it's not an instant UK left need more cash stat

No, I quite agree. They have reserves after all. It's just 10bn is a non-trivial amount, and I'm a bit puzzled as to where they will find it in the mid term. It's a significant chunk of their revenues, and there's never been a year where the EU spent less than the previous year. Much of their investment goes into things that don't pay a return immediately, and when that return is paid it's not obvious or direct into coffers (as per the German households stat you mention above).

My guess is that the EU don't have a plan to plug this gap (their accounts never pass audit...) and they are assuming (like all politicians) that money will arrive from somewhere.

It doesn't help that many on the right (and more recently the left) conflate that with socialism/communism.

2020-06-23 23:22:08,mittro70_,"The Iranian Revolutionary Guards warned, on Tuesday, that it would respond to “any terrorist movements originating from the Kurdistan region of Iraq,” at a time when Turkey is launching a massive attack on what it says are PKK gatherings in northern Iraq, days after targeting villages in northern Erbil, reports The Eastern Herald.

The statements are likely to be related to two main Kurdish groups, the first of which is the Iranian Kurdistan Democratic Party, and the second is the Iranian Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK), which is an extension of the PKK, in addition to other smaller parties, such as the Iranian Kurdistan Kumala Party.

Although the two parties, PJAK and Democrat, are different, whether in terms of strategy or goals, as the Democratic Party wants autonomy for the Kurds in a federal Iran, while “PJAK” raises the slogan of the Kurdish state, Iran treats them equally, often bloody.

“Some terrorist groups infiltrate into Iranian Kurdistan from the Kurdistan region of Iraq,” Commander of the Revolutionary Guards ground commander Major General Muhammad Bakbur said, noting that “Iran will respond to any terrorist movements launched from Iraqi Kurdistan and will not compliment anyone in its national security,” reports The Eastern Herald.

Iran is trying to take advantage of the pressure imposed by the Turkish operations currently taking place inside Iraq to settle its accounts with the Kurdish opponents, as the Revolutionary Guards announced that it conducted extensive exercises near the Iraqi border.

Last week, Iran bombed two border villages, in the north of Erbil Governorate, and the Iraqi Kurdish network “Rudaw” said that the Iranian bombing targeted the headquarters of two Kurdish units opposing the Iranian regime, namely, the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Revolutionary Kumala party of Kurdistan.

Last Saturday, a former Kurdish official, Sadegh Zarza, survived an assassination attempt in a Dutch city by an Iranian man. The Zarza family told The Eastern Herald that the Tehran regime was behind the operation.

A source in the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs told The Eastern Herald that Iraq does not look friendly to armed groups operating from its lands to target neighboring countries.

During the past years, Iran has repeatedly bombarded the sites of the two parties on the Iraq-Iran border, and has killed many of their supporters, and has launched sweeping arrest campaigns against anyone suspected of collaborating with them on its soil.

Mysterious bombings targeted the headquarters of the two parties in Iraqi Kurdistan, accusing Iran of being behind it.

Even before this, Iran used to resort to fierce solutions, usually without appearing willing to conduct a real dialogue with the Kurds on its soil, after “being drawn on the pretext of having a political dialogue.”

Qasimlu was the former head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party.

About 5 to 7 million Iranian Kurds live under conditions described as repressive, as they are prohibited from learning their native language. Iran executed and imprisoned dozens of civilian and political activists, and pursued them even outside Iraq.

The Kurdistan Free Life Party, “PJAK”, was founded in 2004, and it fought extreme conflicts with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, which intensified greatly in the years 2008-2011 before the party formally ended its military operations, but limited clashes are still taking place from time to time.

And “PJAK” is closely related to the PKK, and it is also a left-wing party with a strong-armed wing."

Asked for his reaction on Tuesday at the media briefing, Zhao said, ""China and India are resolving the issue on the ground through military and diplomatic channels.

""As for Indian media reports that cite Indian officials as saying at least 40 Chinese soldiers were killed, I can tell you responsibly that this is false information,"" he said, according to an official transcript released hours later.

This is the first time China has commented on the casualties. The spokesman, however did not elaborate.

Though China has not revealed its casualty figure, there were reports that a commanding officer of the Chinese army was among those killed in the clashes. There is no official confirmation about it.

Ever since the clash on June 15 at the Galwan Valley between the Indian and Chinese troops, Beijing has consistently declined to reveal the details of the casualties on its side, while the official media editorials have said that China too suffered casualties."

2020-06-23 22:16:02,stampingpixels,"Yeah, I get all of that, but you are making an 'Is it good value?' case. I'm not making a judgement on that at all. I'm asking where is the money going to come from. 

So:


&gt;**the single EU market increased the average incomes of Germans by over 1,000 Euros, above the EU average increase of 840 Euros**.

Great, but that cash doesn't flow into the EU It's value to the German people themselves (note- not everyone agrees with Bertelsmann's assessment of benefits and the way they arrive at the figures they quote). 

&gt;Also, the amount they contribute cannot be directly compared, Germany for example is also one of biggest countries in the EU, naturally they'll pay more.

Again, correct, but if the EU is 9.4bn short of their budget in 2021, that per capita contributions in Germany are quite reasonable doesn't help the EU when it's got fuck all in the bank account

&gt;The UK leaving will need to be counterbalanced, but it's not a simple net negative either since they will now have to pay increased tarifs to trade with the EU which they didn't before.

Possibly, but there's more to it than just 'how much of the 10bn can we make up in tariffs?' (and note- there's no guarantee that tarrifs will apply in the end). 

For a start, what if trade goes elsewhere? What if the trade the UK loses with EU it  makes up with India, the Americas, Canada and the Antipodes? Doing business with more distant countries doesn't cost any more (gravity model of trade we know no longer applies- it's why the UK Treasury's predictions of a post Brexit vote recession didn't materialise), so why should the UK trade with a bloc that applies tariffs?

Also, tarrifs are reciprocal- and the UK buys more from the EU than vice versa. A tariff - heavy deal may well eat into those net benefits Bertelsmann claims for german families more than it affects the UK. 


&gt;And while it's easy to talk about benefactors and contributors, the goal is to develop the benefactors so in the long term they can better sustain themselves and pay their dues

And as I said, I've not found an example of this happening. I am probably wrong that it has never happened, but I definitely don't think Poland is all of a sudden going to be throwing billions into the pot to make up for the UK contributions. Even if this does happen, it's a long time away, and there's a hole to fill now."

I hope that this is not the case elsewhere, in other Democratic nations. I realize how valuable universities are and I don't know what we would do if public trust in them were completely eroded.

2020-06-23 21:47:06,IotaCandle,"&gt;Propagandists are propagandists

Well researchers are not propagandists. If I were you I'd read up on the scientific method, because unlike the folks at Mises.org I'm not paid for my typing. 

In short Academia usually relies on the scientific method to find out how the world works. Researchers will gather data and design new methods to gather it, they will emit a hypothesis on the underlying causes behind their results and try to either design experiments or gather more, different data to get a better idea. 

The key to make it work is replication. The methodology for gathering the data, the data itself, the corrections that have been done to it and the conclusion are published so that other researchers may consult it. Peer review simply means a number of rather knowledgeable people read the paper to see if it was worth publishing. 

Other researchers who are familiar with the subject might express criticism of either the methodology, the corrections or the logic behind the conclusion. Everything is up for debate. Ultimately other tea ear chers might actually try to replicate the results of the study : using the same methodology as the previous team to see wether they get the same results. 

The point is that even if conservative professors were outnumbered 10-1 and liberals ran the game, any flaw in their work could be the subject to criticism, and good criticism of widely accepted research is a surefire way to boost your career. 

The system is intended to work despite the bias of researchers."

2020-06-23 21:01:10,xthorgoldx,"No, it's not the same move - it's actually an arm of financial, labor,  and travel law.

Think of it this way: let's say Japan only grants visas to 50,000 foreign teachers per year. This isn't a measure to ""keep foreign ideas out,"" but rather it's designed to prevent the local market from being flooded, *and* to prevent people from using fake pretenses to enter the country (""Oh yeah, I teach English for... one hour, a month, to my wife""). Now, let's imagine that there's a Generic Tutor Company that hires teachers; a bunch of spies get caught, and they're all employees of that company. Consider how the situation changes in different scenarios:

* The company *isn't* affiliated with the spies' government - they thought the spies were legitimate teachers, and were used as cover without their knowledge. All of the other teachers are innocent.
* The company *isn't* affiliated with the government, but it did work with them - they accepted a bribe or other deal to cover for the spies. *Most* of the other employees/teachers are innocent.
* The company was founded, from the getgo, as a front agency - it was never a real company, it's all just cover for the spies. If there are any real teachers, they're the exception.

""Foreign government agents"" are companies that fall into the second and third examples: companies that are either *direct* arms of a foreign government (i.e. not legitimate businesses) or that are far too cozy to be called separate. If Japan was to bar the GTC from sponsoring teacher visas in the *first* case, it would be unfair punishment of an innocent company - but in the second and third cases, it would make perfect sense. ""You're not hiring real teachers, so you can't sponsor teacher visas.""

This is basically the impact that foreign agent declaration has in the US. Organizations that are flagged as illegitimate are forfeited some of the privileges that real companies get, particularly when it comes to travel, financial accountability, legal interactions with US entities, etc. It's not even *close* to a First Amendment issue."
2020-06-23 21:00:37,LogicalSquirrel,"&gt;Literally two comments up you were wondering for what reasons people in academia were mostly democrats.

I don't see where I stated I was wondering this. Maybe I'm overlooking it? I did use the phrase ""for whatever reasons"", but my intent was that I thought the reasons didn't matter for the point I wanted to make.

&gt;You've got your answer. As part of their education they were trained in critical thinking and learned how to find and evaluate scientific research. Depending on their major they ended up with greater knowledge on how the world works. 

Sociology departments in the US often teach things based on social theories that involve very little scientific research.

&gt;Scientific research.

We are discussing universities, the source of most scientific research in the US and perhaps the rest of the world, overwhelming conforming to a particular ideology. They are supposed to find this interesting enough to investigate and report on? As if anyone at one of these institutions would have the balls to even try?

&gt;And there it is. Critical reading involves identifying what type of document you are reading, and who wrote it. Mises was an economist who argued that markets should rule the world and that governments should barely exist if at all. No regulations or age of consent laws. 

This is fair enough. I believed the liberal and increasingly far-left slant of academia was obvious, so I did a quick search for some supporting articles just to respond to you. Having said that, so few right wing staff in academia means that any source that has taken the time to do their homework on this topic will likely come from a right wing think tank. I don't see the difference in value in publicly versus privately funded propaganda. Propagandists are propagandists. The only alternative would be garbage right wing opinion pieces.

&gt;Ironically the reason you know academia leans liberal is because academics took the time to collect, compile and publish that data in peer reviewed journals. It's not as if it was a secret.

Can you provide some sources? I'm genuinely interested in this topic and if you have something better than I found I would love to read it. Thanks."

Even if the procedure didn't have the all of the usual risks of such surgeries (especially in young children, and those risks are highly elevated - medical interventions in early life should be avoided whenever possible), it would still be a basic violation of human rights.

&gt;Now yes, most teachers in the US are democrats. This is because democratic policies make sense, while conservative policies are basically kleptocratic. What passes as radical left wing policies in your country is a reality in most of the developed world

Many traditional Democratic policies focused on things like social safety nets can be effectively argued for, yes. There is a move away from simple economic policy into social realms that disregard traditional liberal values (such as free expression), currently occurring on the American left, however. Also, I'll never understand using ""we do it, so you should too"", though. As if the US and the rest of the world are identical. As if the rest of the world hasn't relied on the US for decades for defense, R&amp;D, etc. I understand the US is currently and idiotically forfeiting this position of leadership, but it is still worth mentioning.

&gt;Those policies work and provide benefits far outweighting their costs, yet if your only source of information was american media you'd think that free healthcare, freeing nonviolent drug offenders and not toppling foreign regimes every 3 years are radical positions. If you froze Biden and brought him over here in Europe with the same program he'd fall off the right side of the spectrum. 

I don't know who outside of boomers is relying on our media for information. It is corrupt and dishonest to the core, regardless of which ""side"" a particular outlet is on. I think most Americans want healthcare reform, we just disagree on how to do it. Most of us are sick of foreign wars, and we are increasingly sympathetic to drug and criminal justice reform.

This bent seems to have recently (past 1-3 decades?) evolved from a traditional liberalism into something else entirely, something based on critical theory (power dynamics of groups, etc.). 

These individuals would like to see society reshaped to be more inclusive, fair, equal. Programs such as Gender Studies are absolutely their wheelhouse, and they send droves of students out into the world armed with this belief set. 

To be upfront, I'm American and I don't know how much this is occuring elsewhere in the world. In the interest of honesty, I'll also state the obvious: I don't agree with this ideology at all. I believe it's dangerous to liberalism, despite the good intentions of its' true believers.

2020-06-23 16:35:21,jnkangel,"Yeah I think this is a subject that will really brutally depend on the lecturer.

You will have lecturers who handle it purely from the perspective of western feminism, some lecturers will handle it from the perspective of more general feminism and while others handle the subject across a significantly broader spectrum.

Mind you - not shitting on feminism here. It very much has a place and should be an integral part of gender studies, but not the sole focus. Hell a comparison of traditional western feminism and some conflicting points of non western feminism are super interesting. But once more should be a segment, not the sole focus.

There’s enough people that shit on feminism for largely focusing on female issues or looking at the world from a female lease, forgetting that the same thing as with BLM versus the people that run around screaming All lives matter applies as well.

One of the issues it probably suffers from is the plethora of different viewpoints of what GS should be about. 

I’m definitely happy to say that my experiences were generally positive though."
2020-06-23 16:34:33,alvaropacio,"Well, if you ask me personally, I obviously find my own reasoning to be solid enough. But just to be sure I did a quick google search for actual gender study degrees, and this is how the first I found describe it:

&gt;Gender Studies is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on the complex  interaction of gender with other identity markers such as race, ethnicity, sexuality, nation, and religion.

Then again it could be just false advertising, so I skimmed through a few colleges' study programmes and they do seem pretty broad, with subjects that cover anthropology, sociology, legislation, education, economics, criminology, health... and promoted career options are just as diverse, from social work teams to cultural industry agents to media channels to advertising."

&gt;To the geniuses saying this is a ban on gender studies alone

&gt;&gt;would ban all educational institutions from “propagating theories and opinion on gender identity according to which gender is a separate concept from biological sex”.

&gt;They just don't like the idea of gender. Although you can argue for gender studies, this is pure censorship of basic ideas. It's directed in part to trans people. It's getting us back to medieval times.

Yeah, budget could be one of the reasons, but then why they hit gender studies specifically? Because they knew chuds like many other commenters here would have a field day applauding the fact that ideas they don't like got oppressed.

Many liberal arts are unprofitable. And supporting fields of studies that aren't profitable is kinda job of public school."

For her, it would be impossible to describe certain social phenomena without applying gender studies. So yeah, it's pretty broad subject that can apply in many disciplines - both in academics, and just in the field.

2020-06-23 16:02:05,Direwolf202,"That is quite simply not so. In biology, we had the theory that there were two sexes (in humans), and that every individual would fit into one of those two categories. This turned out to be false - so we dropped it. Science does not allow exceptions, not physics, not biology, and not sociology. 

But in your example of a foal with three legs, we can conclude correctly that not every foal will be born with four legs. Horses are still quadrupeds because that is not a strict categorization, but a broad description. 

 Sex is not the same, sex is a specific categorization, and it requires an appreciation of ""exceptions"" for practical reasons."

2020-06-23 15:48:46,Direwolf202,"That term is absolutely devaluing the affected people. Why? Firstly, because it is inaccurate - there are intersex people with no specific anatomical differences - but secondly, because it implies that there is something wrong with the people who do have such differences. That is up to them to decide, not us. 

(And a philosophical point: I do not have to hold that people suffering physical deformity are lesser, merely that they are devalued - devaluation is a social condition, not a moral one - and I can say that someone has been devalued while simultaneously believing that they should not be). 

And as you identify, intersex is probably a misnomer. Just as morning sickness can occur at any time of day, intersex people are not necessarily ""between sexes"", they are something else. To be intersex is to be something other than male or female - that is all that there is to it. 

There is no deciding if someone is ""one or the other"", that doesn't play into this. The relevant fact is that they aren't either of the categories. You can't shift reality to do that. Now, if you acknowledge gender as separate from sex, this becomes much easier - because then, you can have people who are actually intersex also be of a particular binary gender - which means that you don't have to put people with Kleinfelter's syndrome into the category of ""male sex"", you can instead say that they are intersex and with male gender - which is both more accurate, and many times more useful. 

One could describe that as the introduction of new sexes, but it is better to think of it simply as a failure of naive categorization - a recognition there no non-trivial categorization which can include everyone."

Irrelevant. If biology was physics, it'd be called physics. The laws of physics are supposed describe how things are factually. This means if we find out things are in a way that is incompatible with the theories we have, it means the theories don't describe reality adequately.\
Biology is similar on the small scale, but to observe traits in species, such as sex, doesn't have the same demand for absolute accuracy and allows exceptions.\
If we discover iron balls floating in midair without any measurable force holding them there against gravity, some new theory is required to explain it. But if a foal has three legs at birth, the explanation is not that actually horses aren't quadrupeds."

It's actually much more complicated than that. Individual genes may cross over between chromosomes during meiosis, resulting in XX males and XY females, or other variations. And that's just in humans, once you get into other species it becomes even more complex.

There are no such things as neat categories or clean lines in biology. Everything is inherently fuzzy. That's why there are a dozen different definitions of what a species is. Ultimately you just have to find a heuristic that is good enough for most cases and deal with the exceptions as they arise."

This is why most western nations and progressive governments (and mind you even conservative governments once they realise their mistake a la Boris Johnson) promote immigration.

2020-06-23 14:59:59,Quantentheorie,"&gt; We're dealing with gender study particularly. 

Yes, but the grounds on which you want to support a ban or defunding must apply equally to all fields of study, so unless you're willing to do away with other studies that fit the criteria you proposed here, it's not a valid criteria. 

I personally have some doubts if gender studies has a strong claim to be it's own degree/major and if they want challenge it's scientific claims then that's something they should pursue. It's why homeopathy should not be a medical degree. But targetting genders studies because you single it out among many economic deadend is not that. 

&gt;  Also we're talking about on what a government can afford and should. A government is concerned with budget and voters. 

Yes we are, and that's why I'm *reminding* you that budget shortage is not an argument for authoritarian and discriminatory policy. Defunding universities because of a vague notion that they're not churning out enough people with degrees the goverment deems ""beneficial to society"" is an extremely controlling governmental move, especially without properly assuming the burden of proof for the claim.

&gt; If you have lots of money, you can even go to abroad to study if your government does not provide funding in your country to study these subjects.

Now you're going to have to explain to me how that's relevant. Because what I'm reading here is that's it's fine because if you're rich enough you can go to a country that *actually* has freedom?"

I agree that Trump and Mattis had differences in opinion and they had personality conflict like Trump had with General Kelly.

Deputies and senators pointed out that the radical conductor exerted ""symbolic, political and media violence"" on Cristina Kirchner Source: Credit File: La Noche de Mirtha.  
Baby Etchecopar not only earned the rejection of Kirchnerism by calling Cristina Kirchner ""the cancer of Argentina"" during the Mirtha Legrand program.  He was also denounced by 65 legislators of the Frente de Todos, mostly women, for gender violence.
The presentation was made before the Public Defender of Audiovisual Communication Services, by Mirian Lewin.  The text indicates that Etchecopar's sayings imply forms of symbolic, political and media violence foreseen in the National Law of Integral Protection to Prevent, Punish and Eradicate Violence against Women, while violating the provisions of Law 26,522 on  Audiovisual Communication.
During the Mirtha Night program (Eltrece), Etchecopar said that while the former president ""dips in politics, there will be no national peace.""  In addition to defining her as ""the cancer of Argentina"", the radio host continued: ""She is a single woman who does not want anyone. She looks in front of the mirror and says' I am splendid to hit heads and I am going to ruin the life of the  people. It must be said. If Cristina continues in Argentina, Argentina ends. ""
The presentation of the official legislators, which indicates ""the assent"" of the rest of the diners ""to the phrase of Etchecopar, also calls on the Public Defender to"" train those responsible for the program in audiovisual production with a gender perspective  ""and"" remedial measures aimed at promoting and protecting the dignified and equal treatment of women in general, and specifically of women who work in the political sphere in the audiovisual media, are implemented.

Do you really think Presidents work morally ignoring the interest of MIC/SS/DS ? That's naïve. I agree they do what's best for their reelection but they don't do anything moral.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But with both the example of withdrawing troops from Germany and abandoning Syria to Turkey and Iran I just don't see how that would be in the interest of MID/SS/DS.  

It's clear if you follow the US security state's recent decisions, they just don't see Russia as the prime enemy anymore no matter how much democrats screech trying to tie Trump to Putin. They see China as the bigger threat and US is ramping up their operation in South China Sea. The big game is no more in the Western/ Eastern Europe. US is investing massively in modernizing nuclear weapon and NATO is expanding but the threat to global US hegemony doesn't come from Russia, it comes from China. 

And, when it comes to Syria, that decision made all the strategic sense. US figured out Syria is a lost case. Russia has it in control and US can't directly attack Iranian proxies and endanger all its troops all around the middle east. US has pulled out and gave Israel the full license to strike Syria from Lebanese airspace. Perfect strategy. And US never cared about the Kurds, they were just pawn for US geopolitical gain. US fed the same Kurds to Saddam in First Gulf War and helped Saddam to gas the Kurds in Iran Iraq war. The strategy US chose is to deprive Syrian regime from its oil fields and sanction them  (Caesar Act) to death to weaken Assad to the extent that he has no other option but to come to a political solution that favors US. Also to weaken him to an extent he can't be a threat along with Iran and Hezbollah to US's other allies. 

Honestly, these decisions make perfect sense to me. I would like to know how these decisions weakened US interest."

#The Rock and Ursula von der Leyen to co-host corona event
European Commission chief to co-host concert and summit featuring Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber.

He's starred alongside Rachel Weisz, Vin Diesel and a crocodile named Lizzie, but now Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson is preparing to share the limelight with ... Ursula von der Leyen.

The president of the European Commission will join the former wrestler turned action movie lead as co-hosts of a global coronavirus pledging summit and concert on Saturday.

[Details of the event](https://www.politico.eu/article/commission-global-citizen-and-celebs-launch-second-corona-response/) were first revealed late last month. The Commission [on Monday](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_1129) gave more information on those who will take part.

The goal is to raise donations from everyone — not just major countries and philanthropists — to help find diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines to fight coronavirus.

Von der Leyen and Johnson — whose box office hits include ""Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle"" and ""The Mummy Returns"" — will co-host the event, which will include performances by Christine and the Queens, Shakira, Coldplay, Usher, Jennifer Hudson, Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber.

The concert — which is part of the Global Goal: Unite For Our Future campaign launched by the Commission and the anti-poverty movement Global Citizen — will also feature appearances by Chris Rock, Hugh Jackman, Charlize Theron, Forest Whitaker, David Beckham and Salma Hayek.

It will be broadcast by a number of European TV channels and on social media.

In a statement, von der Leyen said: “Artists have the power to inspire change. They use their talents to serve great causes. On 27 June, at the ‘Global Goal: Unite for our Future' Summit and Concert, artists, scientists and world leaders will speak with one voice, in a true and rare moment of global unity. They will commit to helping the world end coronavirus, while leaving no one behind. The European Union is fully committed to ensuring fair access to an affordable vaccine, as soon as possible, for everyone that needs it. United, I know we can make the world a safer place.”"

Much like Turkey that perpetually sits on the fence between pro-European Kemalism and Islamic conservatism, such a nation will never join the EU.

2) Russia's minimum demand is a neutral Ukraine, and they have the capabilities to enforce it. That's what the Donbas conflict is all about. So either we need to push Russia out militarily, but I don't see the political will for a WWIII in Europe. Or we make a deal with Russia, but I don't see what we could offer that Russia deems more valuable than a neutral Ukraine.

3) Even in the case of a comprehensive EU-Russia deal, Ukraine's politcal and economic instability precludes an immediate EU accession. But there cannot possibly be an accession period of 10 to maybe even 30 years. We can't trust the Russians for that long, neither do the Russians trust us, and I don't see the Ukrainians trusting us for that long either, meaning the pro-European majority will probably crumble eventually before accession can be finalized. And what if they can't fix the economy and curb corruption within that timeframe? The only way out I see is immediate EU accession but complete EU oversight over Ukraine for a period of even up to a quarter century. An EU anti-corruption agency, EU-appointed judiciary, EU veto on Ukrainian laws etc. This would be a very hard pill for Ukraine to swallow, first giving up territory to Russia for the Russia deal and then giving up sovereignty to the EU for the EU deal, and I don't see the political will for something like that in Ukraine."

The legitimate government under international law is whichever government is recognised by the United Nations. In both these cases France attacked the legitimate government.

It should also be noted that, in the case of Syria, France itself still acknowledges Assad's regime as the legitimate government of Syria, and bombed it anyway. They are clearly not intervening on behalf of an opposition government."

If gender is as simple as fashion trends and stereotypes within a certain culture, then that is certainly worthy of study, becuase in almost every culture that I'm aware of, it's much more complicated and important than that. 

And we do not know to what degree gender is genetic, that is a point worthy of study - we would want to know the degree to which it is genetic - and that is only one specific problem, and not really one that gender-studies is concerned with beyond the implications of its answer. We know a lot about gender in a lot of ways, but the fact that our knowledge of it is limited is precisely why we need to study it.

Also you also say that you dont know to what degree gender is genetic or not, whatever you mean with that sentence. If you do not know anything why is there a degree for it? cmon.

But with both the example of withdrawing troops from Germany and abandoning Syria to Turkey and Iran I just don't see how that would be in the interest of MID/SS/DS. Both decisions seems to be far more harmful to the US global interests in the long run than they are to the nations they are being targeted at or for the benefit short term US self-interest.

Can you confirm that people only choose this study as an easy cop-out or because their parents will pay it in full? Why is it useless as opposed to other studies? Generally, I'm just curious where you get these ideas from.

I think a relatively new study field that highlights different ideas and schools of thought, previously not part of mainstream consciousness, can be difficult for the public to swallow at first. The vigor of its students can come off strong as well, because they see things through a new lense and want to share this with others, which can be in an unfortunately abrasive way. It makes people shut themselves off from others who try a more reasonable approach, resulting in them resorting to a more extreme approach

It's no grateful task to be a professor or student of such studies, trying to make people aware of what you see, asking for the attention it deserves, needing to resort to ways people find confrontational and finding the public closed off, only to see governments starting to role back gender equality policies.

So in an ironic twist, governments shutting it down makes it even more impertinent that these studies stay in place and have people doing research."

&amp;#x200B;

Gender studies is almost entirely politically motivated at this point and has almost nothing to do with actually studying people.

2020-06-23 12:28:20,pbjtime12,"“Sexologist John Money introduced the terminological distinction between biological sex and gender as a role in 1955. Before his work, it was uncommon to use the word gender to refer to anything but grammatical categories.[1][2]“ If gender then meant the societal roles somebody has, then somebody who has 50% masculine roles and 50% feminine roles could consider themself something other than male or female as they wouldn’t fit themselves with the male gender or the female gender as they are equally both and equally neither. 

However, it being a term created that recently to describe destinctions between roles in society, denying its ability to evolve as a term is foolish. But even if you deny the current definition(s) of gender, a term needs to exist to define masculine and feminine traits. That is why gender was picked up as that term. 

Claiming that it means whether you have a penis or vagina is completely wrong. It originally meant if a word was feminine or masculine."
2020-06-23 12:27:52,hyperbolicplain,"Both my examples were very strongly advised against by nearly every single one of his military advisors.

I was never arguing that allies matter to Trump, they obviously don't. But to say he has little influence on foreign policy when he can dramatically alter it with one unexpected and ill-advised tweet cannot be very reasuring to either his advisors, his officials or special interest lobbyists.

You are right though, if you can manipulate him predictably then you weild some real power, I just don't beleive anyone can manipulate him predictably and/or consistently. He is a loose cannon who thinks he is a king rather than an elected public servant, and all the checks and balances that are supposed to prevent this kind of thought becoming a reality are falling woefully short."
2020-06-23 12:27:05,Oblivion_Wonderlust,"&gt;	There is very little within gender studies that is based on credible scientific experiments, as opposed to surveys or opinion polls.

Surveys and polls are in fact valid and credible scientific experiments and fall under the category of natural and field experiments (as opposed to controlled experiments) and utilise multivariable analyses (rather than isolating a given variable as done in lab experiments) to make and test predictions. This is because it would be virtually impossible as well as excessively expensive to perform said experiments in a controlled environment.

For example, testing the effects dietary choices on heart health. A cardiologist could predict that certain foods are better for the heart than others but the only way to test that hypothesis would be to go around asking people with good and bad hearts about what they eat. You can’t just take a thousand babies and feed some of them a different diet for 80 years to see how many on that diet are still alive.

Gender studies, like all social sciences are concerned with how people affect the society they are in and how people are effected by the society in which they live, therefore, the best method of data collection for these sciences is going out and asking people what they think about a certain subject. This is very similar 

Hypotheses and theories made by social-sciences are both testable and repeatable and are employed in fields like Advertising, Marketing, and Human Resource Management. 

You could, if you wanted, go out and test the hypotheses made by gender-studies scholars and get the same results.

Just saying “this doesn’t feel like real science” does not in fact make it not a real science. Facts don’t care about your feelings."

My point is quite simply that male and female are not accurate descriptors for many intersex people, that's all that matters there. 

Clothing has not had nearly as much of a profound influence on culture as gender has done. Why? Because unlike fashion, which is mostly unimportant for many people. Gender makes its effects known for everyone, no matter who they are - social expectations are placed on everyone for their gender - who you are willing to date is most often determined by gender - and naturally, people are discriminated against because of their gender, on the scale of countries.

2020-06-23 12:13:45,gingerfreddy,Useless? It's a piece of the puzzle to study how humans interact. Not explaining how gender affects human relation is like not studying how age or physical ability shapes a person.

I don't know why you'd be insulting psychiatrists.

2020-06-23 12:10:39,DCFY7439,"Yes. But there are other advisors/players. When i am talking about Security state/Deep State, I am not talking about Republican senators, they don't count. They have their masters. They are pawns. Their foreign policy is totally dependent on who they take their campaign donation from. 

The ones that count are Secretary of State, CIA Chief, Pentagon Chief, DIA Chief, Special lobby groups (like the Israeli, Saudi, Emirati, Turkish ones), defense contractors etc etc. They are the ones who has a direct ear of Trump and they are the ones who matter. Yes, Trump can make policy decisions like Arms control treaty or like negotiations and stuff but when it comes to wars, intelligence, meddling, coup etc. etc. all these more hands on, real stuff- Trump has no control. 

Syria issue is an interesting one. Obviously Erdogan influenced Trump. Kurds had no other way so they went in and made a deal with Assad. Ultimately, US foreign policy is driven by its own interest. US security state felt more utility in letting Erdogan to invade and deal with YPG while US soldiers can block Syrian access to oil fields. I just don't see Trump made that decision unilaterally. All the people who had his ear definitely advised him to do this and Lindsey Graham &amp; Marco Rubio don't have his ear when it comes to this type of decision. 

And you said defense and state was against his Syria move. Which state department's spokesperson or someone employed in Pentagon came out against his decision? I can't seem to remember any. Do you?"

Dude same.

&gt; And if gender is irrelevant as a fashion trend, then it wouldn't have had such a profound influence on our culture as it has done.

Clothing has had a profound influence too. I don't see your point. Ancient tribes have intricate headdresses and such, to do with different traditions and beliefs, just like gender.

&gt; I've gone into this in another comment chain, and I'm not repeating it here, but ultimately, sex is way more complicated than that - those exceptions to the norm are actually quite common (relatively speaking), and they seriously matter. 

Sex is not, actually.

To be intersex (0.05 or 1.7 percent, depending on who you ask and whether you include chromosome differences that do not result in morphological differences) is to have these variations. I'd put it in the middle of those, given both the increase in research into it but also the political weight of the subject.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex

You say you would like to respect the scientific method, well, if you were to find a event that occurs, with an explanation, a very small percentage of the time, we would call that an outlier, and deem it to be not indicative of the overall process or nature of an event, object, etc."
2020-06-23 12:06:14,dekachin5,"&gt;Are US media allowed to print anything that US security state/deep state doesn't allow them to print?

The US media don't need permission, unlike in China, so there is no ""allowed"". They do whatever the fuck they want. The US government just said Bolton's book had classified info in it and wasn't done with the vetting process, and the media gave 0 fucks and released excerpts from the book as fast as they could get them.

Most famously, the government tried to stop the Pentagon Papers in 1971 and failed. 

Classified information exists and laws against its publication exist, but when it comes to matters of public interest, the government has to meet a very high standard to block publication.

Trying to equate this with China, which fucking banned Animal Crossing because the whiny babies in the CCP got mad that HKers posted anti-CCP slogans from art made in the game, is laughable. The CCP dictates to its propaganda outlets what to say."

And we don't actually know to what degree gender is genetic or not - there isn't a gene for wearing a skirt, but gender certainly isn't a choice - gender presentation (the act of wearing the skirt in order to represent your gender) is a choice (to the extent that one is subject to the stereotypes surrounding their gender)."

The US Constitution gives huge powers to the President for foreign policy, and at best Congress can try to defund him (and he can fund it anyway with emergency funds like he used to build some wall)."
2020-06-23 11:46:34,jnkangel,"Look at the article- it's not just the subject of gender studies that is banned. It's much broader. And secondary education in America has sex ed in many places, which deals with gender, sex and sexual attraction. The moment you would hold some of these as separate items, you would run against the ban. 

&gt;The law approved on Tuesday by Romanian lawmakers would ban all educational institutions from “propagating theories and opinion on gender identity according to which gender is a separate concept from biological sex”."

Teaching and writing books about gender studies. Not kidding, they will tell you this in college.

This is not a problem unique to gender studies. The entire field of Western philosophy has the same problem, as do degrees in art, history, literature, and music. Music is especially bad because I've known dozens of professional musicians and not one of them had a music degree."
2020-06-23 11:45:48,alvaropacio,"It's a broad interdisciplinary field that studies the cultural and social distinctions between masculinity and femininity, it pretty much intersects with any area that studies human interactions or behaviour. For example, if you want to study life in ancient Greece, you may want to know how that society treated men and women differently. If you study political science, you may want to know if women within a certain group statistically vote differently or according to different criteria than men, and why, and additionally if there are additional factors defining that difference. If you're analyzing Pride and Prejudice, conventions about femininity in early 19th century England may come into play. So on and so forth, basically ""what is different for men and women, and doesn't involve the crotch whatsoever""."

In physics, if we come up with an exception to our current theory, we dispose of the theory - this has happened with those traditional ideas of sex. 

And if we classified people by the nature of their limbs, I'm sure we would consider people born without a limb to be a separate kind of person.  

And if gender is irrelevant as a fashion trend, then it wouldn't have had such a profound influence on our culture as it has done. We wouldn't have a whole range of myths and legends and tropes built upon it. And I should remind you that a huge amount of culture varies in these ways - including every single one of the foundational ideas of western economics."
