2020-06-25 19:46:09,Chris_-,"Statistically, given the size of the universe, most scientists agree that it's incredibly likely that there are other intelligent life forms.

You've probably read articles on how big the earth is in comparison to the rest of the universe. For instance, if earth was the size of a grain of sand, our sun would be the size of a cue ball in billiards. The next NEAREST star to our sun would be about 977 miles (1572km) away; about the distance from Baltimore to Miami

The likelyhood of our grain of sand being the only one with some intelligent life on it? Seems like quite an assumption to me. Thus, it is likely that there is other intelligent life, but we do not currently have evidence or proof.

--

Going further

If our solar system (sun to pluto) was a grain of sand, our milky way galaxy would be 31 miles wide. The next nearest galaxy, Andromeda, would be 629 miles away.
Now consider all millions of galaxies that are millions of light years further away. Is it still reasonable for you to assume we're still the only intelligent ones?

He used to be quiet, have huge puffy hair and would sit in the corner of the hallway playing his guitar. At that time, he wasn't considered a heart throb whatsoever by all the girls I knew, but he seemed nice. He was close friends with some of my friends who are good people, so that seems to speak to his character. When he won a Tony award, on stage he thanked our sophomore year English teacher, which was awesome."

I disagree with the argument, I think it is entirely possible to be tolerant of the intolerant and have a functioning society, given a well-designed societal structure.  But that’s just me."

Well the first time he witnessed a psychotic breakdown, he was a little creeped out for sure, but he stayed. He stayed for every one of them. I wholeheartedly believe that your SO is seeing your ""moods"" in the same light as my husband sees mine. You and I are born with something we cannot control, but sadly controls a part of our life.

Tim had a girlfriend. He had a kid with her. But they broke up shortly after. She then started dating Tom, things worked out and they had a kid together.

At this point, you'd think Tim and Tom aren't getting along very well anymore. But you'd be wrong. Tim and Tom live together with this girl they each had a kid with. And better yet: they live with my uncle, his new wife, and their cumulative 8 children.

Didn’t know much about the city since I lived in the hood a fair portion of my life. One day Im walking the halls looking at the trophy cases of Heights High and this girl and I strike up a conversation, nothing too extravagant just hey how are you and I like your shoes blah blah. Turns out that girl is fucking Lori Harvey, Steve’s daughter, and he’s touring the school with the principal (he went to heights when he was a teen). When I tell you I was so shook when I saw her walk up to Steve like it was nothing."

After it ends, don't agree to meet up with them, and block their number if possible. 

Mine only lasted a couple of months, and it was emotional abuse rather than physical, so it could have been a lot worse, but it still did a number on me. 

Not going into details just in case, but be aware. If someone starts telling you that your friends aren't actually your friends, that's a major red flag (one that I missed).  If you find yourself less stable emotionally as a result of a current relationship, something's wrong. Talk to someone about it, and listen to what they have to say."

3. Ordered a mattress that worked for me
4. Bought comfortable blankets and pillows
5. Covered up my window with cardboard, foil, black duck tape and a blanket so no light could creep in
6. Bought a small fan to keep the room chilled


Basically it was changing habits and treating sleep like any other activity I was interested in doing, I bought the right tools for the job. 

Bonus:

On days that I am really tired, I don't let my two pups sleep with me, and make them sleep on the floor on their own pillows. That way I can have the bed to fully stretch out and relax in."

After several warnings from yours truly, he didn't seem to be letting up and was making my sweet friend more and more uncomfortable. My friend was not confrontational at all, and was just the SWEETEST human, so I was furious. I gathered up this kid's lunch, picked it up and walked to the middle of the commons with it. I threw it all down on the ground, and yelled at him to come pick it up. A few tables turned to watch. At first, he laughed and kind of looked incredulous about the situation, then I said it again and stood there pointing at his floor lunch and he eventually got up and cleaned it.

The entire game any time I’d run by he would say something sexual to me. I just gritted my teeth and ignored it, but it was nonstop during the whole game.

At the end when our two teams lined up to high five each other he put himself directly behind me in line and said yet another sexually suggestive thing.

I just lost it and turned around and slapped him HARD in front of everyone. The teams, the coaches, the parents, everyone. He was dumbstruck.

We are by far the wildest and most violent of animals. The fossil records of most larger animals consistently disappear completely soon after we show up to a place. We love genocide, rape, and gore in general. History is way too full of any debauchery you could possibly think of.

when FARMS (a morg org) and the UTLM (an anti-morg org) are saying the same thing, except FARMS is saying 'it's not as bad as it looks, we just used to absolutely cover this up - and excommunicated people who mentioned it -  because it looks bad.

and then there are the things which are indisputable - the civil war prophecy in D&amp;C 87 is promoted by the church as a 'proof' of smith's prophetic nature, but a simple look at other contemporaneous sources show it was nothing more than a commentary on what **everyone else was talking about**

when I last looked at the church finances, probably around 2012, I recall someone had done an informal audit of everything the church had published about it's charitable donations compared with a carefully worked out estimate at it's worldwide income (although it is secret in the US, some countries actually require a real audit)
I think the figure was 7 cents on the dollar spent on charity
I recall it was 2012, because that was the year that the presiding bishop of the church revealed that the church had spent $6 BILLION on city creek mall

finally, your point about 'asking god' - yeah super.... I have read a little psychology since leaving the church and all you are really doing is tapping into your own cognitive biases - the same as every catholic, Muslim, seventh day Adventist, jehovahs witness, etc, etc"

2020-06-25 19:43:59,RechargedFrenchman,"Not me personally, but one of my history professors in university remembers having Ryan Reynolds signed up for a couple of his classes. Sometimes he's even attend them!

By this point Reynolds around 20 while hardly the big star he is today was already acting, and not exactly the most diligent student. Frequently missing class for filming, or to have a bit of free time outside filming. 

My dad has also met and of all things played Rugby with him -- someone on my dad's team was somehow related and Reynolds was in town so he came out to a practice -- a while back. Already ""famous"" by this point but before he got *really* famous, I'd that makes sense. He'd ""made it"" but wasn't at the sort of star power he is presently. 

In both cases apparently he was very much what you'd expect, if a bit quieter and shy-er than he usually is on TV. But he also regularly says in interviews he's never considered himself a very outgoing person and gets bad stage fright and stuff, he's just gotten very good at sort of working through it. Which is also why he's always so sarcastic and joking on camera; it helps him cope with the situation and deal with the stress and discomfort. 

So hanging out with a bunch of guys shooting the shit and playing touch rugby was fairly easy and low pressure, and Reynolds was pleasant and friendly enough."

Once of my favorite bands at the time was Dain Bramage who Dave Grohl was drummer. Just watching him you could see he was heads above anyone playing at that time. I would hang out with him after their sets and would frequently run into him at other shows and venues. He was one of the nicest people I ever encountered in the punk scene and he's pretty much the same person you see today as I knew back then.

2020-06-25 19:43:57,FriedGamer,"Perfect timing. This happened 2 weeks ago.

So, I'm the quiet ass guy that never talks to anyone in class. People tend to underestimate me in everything I do, mostly because I'm not the best in class. (I honestly am an average student, not the worst, not the greatest). I'd always let people take credit for my work in projects, I'd always help with others problems, and I was kind of a weak pathetic child on the outside. I'm also kind of an idiot, you'll see why close to the end of the story.

 So, there *was* this one dumb idiot on the class, Let's call em Johnny. He's like the bully in these stories for young teenagers. ""Cool"", pretty bulky, some girls want him for *some* reason, and he had blonde hair with green-ish eyes. Basically the guy that you'd like to fist if he acted smug on you. He'd constantly mock me by insulting me about my clothes (I just like wearing black bruh), push me around, and throw things at me. I'd stay silent all the time because I didn't wanna put this kids ego out of it's misery.

So, I've been in the same class with this fool for 3 years. Always acting smug, cool, and always looking down on others as if they were trash.

He made the horrible mistake of underestimating me.

You see, this jackass takes pride by the fact that his dad has a boxing training place or something like that. So throught the 3 years he'd act as if he was gonna punch me. At the beginning it worked, i would flinch back. Thought in my opinion I think that counts as natural reaction and not fear? Anyway, after the first 1.5 years I got used to it and I didn't even react to him.

2 Weeks ago he tried to fake punch me in front of the girls so i would flinch back and fall on the lockers. At this point, I've gotten sick and tired of this shit happening like 3-4 times every god damn week. I respond to him, not missing a second after the fake punch ""Mate, Johnny, just stop. We all know you're too much of a pussy to hit me, stop acting as if people give a shit about what you do.""

I could tell he was surprised because his expression was like ""wtf this dude speaks?"" Then he starts going all like ""Pfft, Heh, this kid.""

""I'm 5 months older than you, jackass.""

The whole hallway is filled with the pleasent ""ouuuuu..."" from the other students.

Him: ""You want a piece of me, asshole? I'll fucking beat the shit out of you!""

Me: ""A piece of you ain't worth shit to me, so I'll take the whole package. Come at me, fuckhead.""

He didn't know I knew martial arts. And I was *damn good at them*. That jackass didn't even train with his father. He's *that* stupid.

He literally turns this into an anime fight. ""EvErYoNe StEp BaCk, Or YoU mIgHt GeT hIs BlOoD oN yOuR sHiRt."" 

I kinda wanted to do nothing, and let him punch me so that he'd get grounded or expelled or something. That was until I realised, I can beat the fuck out of him and **ridicule the living fuck out of this hoe.**

I could tell he had absolutely no fighting experience. He charged his blow as far as his hand can go, and instead of going straight forward, he tried to hit me on the cheek. 

You'll think I'm joking, but I literally grabbed his fist (which for a fist from a guy as bulky as he was, it was pretty pathetic), Punched him in the stomach, proceeded with an uppercut, put my  leg behind his own, and pushed him backwards, while I was holding his left hand making him drop down on the floor and hit his head. I swear the rage of 1 year was focused on each of my attacks. 1 was the gut punch, 1 was the uppercut, and the last 1 was the push.

The entire hallway just stares like ""HOLY FUCKING SHIT"", while he was looking at me while on the ground in complete disbelief.

I say in the most cool-ass voice i can make ""Another one bites the dust, motherfucker."" After that the principal came and both of our parents were informed. My parents weren't even angry after I explained what Johnny had done to me these last 3 years.

Now here's where I explained why I'm an idiot (from the beginning of the story). You see, after the fight his ""pride was wounded"". He didn't talk much, his friends constantly supported him saying ""It's OK, things like that happen."" And people were looking at me as If i was a dickhead. The funny thing is that THEY ***KNEW*** WHAT HE WAS DOING TO ME FOR SO LONG. Guess what I did.

1 week later. ***I***, went and apologized to ***HIM***. I, who was constantly being basically fucking BULLIED by this dude, was the one that apologized first, instead of him for being a dick to me and my friends.

""you should be sorry man, now all the student's look at me like i'm a toddle-""

Me: ""The fuck you said bruh?""

He says it was a ""joke"". Sure it was. He apologized after and we're ""good friends"" according to everything all the other students say in the school. Honestly I still feel kinda bad for him, even thought I shouldn't. He deserved most of the things I did to him 2 weeks ago. I might post this on r/ProRevenge as a full story, lol.

**tl;dr**: Dude who was bullying me for 3 years gets fucked from me, then I apologize to him."

All drug addicts, including the mother, which should not be surprising to anyone who watched this show.  Today, they are apparently reformed, and they run an extremely pandering podcast that’s impossible to listen to (they do what I call the “LA And.”  Where you say ayyyyyynd between every sentence.  The worst type of LA talk)."

2020-06-25 19:43:34,alienonymous2,"My current neighbors. I live in a building at the 2nd floor. They are in the appartment just below us. When they moved in it was around 10pm and it was dark outside already. Of course they made a lot of noises but we said nothing because we assumed that they came from far away and moving in or out makes noises no matter what so it's not their fault.  
Fast forward 1am. They have 2 kids, one baby and one around 4yo I think. At 1am, their baby started crying. Loudly. We were trying to sleep but obviously we couldn't fall asleep with this kid screaming. We were angry, of course, but we, again, said nothing because moving in can be a pretty stressful event, even for babies. Except, the parents did nothing. By that I mean they let the baby cry and scream for more than one hour. At this point we were rightfully pissed but we did not want to start a fight with our brand new neighbors so we took upon ourselves.  
After a full hour of screaming his lungs out, the baby fell asleep (lucky bastard) but we don't. We were fully awake. So we decided that it would be useless to try to sleep at that point. My SO and I went on our respective laptops. I was in our bed and he was at his desk (which is also in the bedroom). Around 3am, he decided to go to the fridge, grab something to eat. He was wearing slippers the whole time. And 5 minute after, guess what. A knock on our door. It was the freaking neighbor. He tried (tried because he knows almost no words in our language) to give us shit because the sound of the slippers on the floor were making too much noises and may woke the baby up.  
They moved in at 10pm, making a lot of noises, and let their baby scream for an hour at 1am and we said nothing and the guy has the audacity to complain that the slippers were making too much noises ! Something that wouldn't have happened if he hadn't let his baby cry in the middle of the night for an hour.  
By chance, my SO is a pretty scary guy so the neighbor was a bit shocked when he saw that huge tattooed bearded punk guy opening the door. I think he was scared enough because after that, he never knocked on our door again.   
We still hate them because their children are uncontrolable monsters who always make noises and they obviously don't care about them. They let the kids do whatever they want, day or night. We avoid them as much as possible and we don't say hello to eatch other when we pass by. And I'm sure they hate us too and avoid us like the plague."

2020-06-25 19:43:31,Rookie64v,"There are two problems.

The first one is that the society in case of a violent conflict generally takes the side of the woman, which basically ends your chances at being a normal human unless you get the hell away from that place. Good luck trying to get rid of the ""fucker that hurt that poor girl"" reputation, she wasn't really hurting you anyway in their opinion (I took a couple of half-assed slaps on the body and yeah, they don't really hurt, but I am not going to say cosplaying a sandbag is fun either).

The second one is that at least I have no idea how much force is enough and I'm likely to hurt the average woman unintentionally, or at least hurting more than intended. I once hurt my ex when she tried to slap my back and hit my arm instead: is a punch to the gut at half power even safe? Should I try to just overpower and wrestle to the ground? Is there something that won't bruise the hell out of her unless it is calibrated for mice? Even a rough block could break a tiny untrained woman's arm for all I know.

Luckily I've not been in a repeated assault situation, but I can totally see why a man is incentivized to just endure if there is the option."

Also lucid dreaming will leave you tired if you do it too much. So set a tiem for doing it. Doing it in the day time is best as you are most awake.

I remember reading somewhere that someone's child broke their playstation by shoving a bunch of toys in it or something like that. instead of replacing it right away, the parent just kept it there.

so where the kid tried to use the playstation again, the parent said ""it doesn't work because you broke it by shoving a bunch of stuff in it, remember?""

and then they replaced it after many months.

basically taught the kid not to break stuff and expect it to magically be fixed all of a sudden

idk I thought it was an ok way of teaching them to be responsible for how they handle their belongings without yelling at them or replacing things indefinitely"

At first, he raved about how great of a man RuPaul is and even asked which pronouns to use. Harvey even said he (Harvey) has grown a lot as a person over the years and is keeping an open mind. So I thought “Oh great. Good for him.” Yeah. That lasted all of 30 seconds. He then  proceeded to treat the actual drag queens like circus animals. Every joke he made was at their expense. He even said RuPaul and his cis girl friend were “normal” but the other contestants got “freakier” as they went down the line (the other contestants being Carson Kressley and two drag queens.) He wouldn’t even shake their hands. Carson went in for a hug at the end of the show and Harvey wouldn’t hug him. I didn’t know much about Harvey before that episode, but I lost all respect for him. If he’s willing to act that way ON camera? Hot damn. What is he like when the camera’s off??

I saw him going into the bathroom and followed him. He was taking a piss at a urinal and I ran up behind him and put every bit of strength I could into slamming his head into the wall. Broke his nose, there was quite a bit of blood, and he was knocked out. I walked out and was never punished for it. Come to find out later I had seriously broke his nose and slightly fractured his skull."

And I'm not saying slavery was ever right cause it wasn't it was fucked up and it ended way later than it should have, but all I am saying is that I fly the flag for southern pride, not for racism. Not for slavery, not for any fucked up issues America once had and some of it still today with racism.

The trials are set up by the bridesmaids. Usually the guys will have to drink a cocktail of disgusting liquids mixed together or do something embarrassing. Not sure how this proves his love but okayyy. 

In this case, the bridesmaids made the guys, including the groom, lick melted chocolate that's smeared onto the inside of diapers, and a test of who can swallow the most out of a banana. Of course all these are videoed down by the wedding videographer team.

I was already disgusted when they posted snippets on igstory. Imagine seeing the full video played out on screen during the wedding banquet where hundreds of family and friends, many of those present are elders. The hall was so quiet, barely anybody applauded once the video finished playing."

Paul Rudd’s was the only one in color, too. It was so funny bc the theater department is so shitty but they desperately cling onto Rudd as if it was *them* who made him the actor he is, instead of his natural ability and graduate degree. 

I left after a year (bc of aforementioned shittiness), but still had a ton of leftover headshots, so I gave them to my friend who still attended and she taped them over a bunch of the headshots in the room, including Paul Rudd, as a prank.

As a for instance, if it's a random hug out of nowhere and I don't have time to react then I often won't even think about it.  

It's all to to do with the mind, the male mind, and only certain male minds to be precise. It's not at all the fault of the women. And again with close friends and family (at least for me) it's not even a thing because my mind doesn't associate them in a sexual way at all."

Now that my team is together its time to plan, Pauline and I argue over how we gain entry, she wants to scale down from the roof while Johnny blasts open the front door as a distraction, however she's my ex girlfriend so i dont want her to get hurt, finally Damian pulls me apart from the group and talks sense into me, making some comments about how Mama wouldnt like how im acting and after four flash backs i agree to their plan.

The next day is game day, the big one, heist day, as Pauline uses the distraction given to us by Johnny, James shots his sniper rifle from across the street on the next roof top, the bullet bounces off muliple metal plates until finally it goes straight through the bank's vault's lock and the door swings open, success. As i slip into the vault i hear a great thud and some laughing over the vault's intercom
""Did you really think you could rob my bank Conrader?"" Damm, i should have known this bank was owned by my childhood nemesis, Steven 
""You were such a fool to trust me"" what? No! Thats Pauline's voice! How could i not expect my ex girlfriend to betray me?
""Now i shall be calling the police to arrest your stupid ass"" damm i really hate Steven
As a police officer walks into the security room i smirk and start laughing
""What? Why are you laughing? I've wo- ughkh"" 
""Conrader you all good in there?"" There he is, the final member of my crew Axel -Master of disguise-
""Yeah of course, now get Pauline and get me the hell out of this box!"" The door to the vault swings open and i see my whole crew, i smile at Pauline knowing that her betrayal was all apart of the plan, we grab the money and run but as we put all the money in the car we hear real police sirens in the distance, as we finish putting the money in the car it sparks to life and Damian speeds off as the cops arrive and take us into custody

As for your original question, just sitting them down and telling them in a straightforward and direct manner, showing that it’s something you’ve completely accepted that neither of you can change, is the best way to go about it. Chances are they’ll be supportive, if not now then in the future.

I also went to school with Taylor Swift’s brother, Austin Swift, and no offense to him but he was SUPER annoying. It was really sad though because a lot of people tried to be friends with him because of his sister’s fame. Taylor would get these contracts and get really nice merchandise so people would try to be friends with Austin to get like really nice shoes and stuff. 

Taylor also shot a music video at my high school and used my senior prom set as a set for her video “You Belong with Me.” Several of my classmates were extras for the video. I was dating a guy really into hard rock at the time and we were “too cool” for that kind of thing and hated country music so we didn’t try to be in the video. Which of course I later regret because I today I could’ve been like oooh I was an extra in a Taylor Swift video.

2020-06-25 19:40:35,meofcoursenot,"I used to get really bad nightmares and learned how to lucid dream because of it. For me the best way to practice lucid dreaming is when you have the same dream over, because you already know what is going to happen. While sleeping, that's when the other tips people have mentioned come into play- asking yourself is this a dream? Has this happened? What's off? Whatever gets you to realize it is a dream. From there you just practice making choices against what should be happening. For me this was doing something crazy to get out of the nightmare when I was little, now a days it's controlling the little things; aka I can be like: eat that glutenous pizza that you can't have irl (thanks celiacs, haha) without panicking. It takes practice, and journalling once you wake up or telling someone to help you remember can help too. I'm naturally a light sleeper so I don't know about the clock/noise tricks work.

2020-06-25 19:40:33,Aperture_T,"Well, it was a 4-ish hour rant, so I don't know that it's fair to say the whole thing echoes in my head, but I'm fairly sure it's the worst thing my dad has ever said though.

Basically, he went on about how I'm terrible, and my generation is terrible, and he's better than me, and his generation is better than mine, because we're all dirty commies and he's not. There was a bunch of ""I'm not racist but"" racist stuff, a bunch of proudly homophobic stuff, and some other assorted bigotry. There was some conspiracy theory stuff, with a bit of antisemitism, although I don't think he was aware of that part.

There was stuff about how he's better than me because he's a moderately successful businessman, and he bitches about how his employees are lazy because they're not willing to commit everything to his business, and how the fall of company loyalty is their fault for asking too much.

There was another part where he complains that nobody's willing to have a rational discussion about this, which is ironic because he was shouting over me for the first half hour or so before I gave up.

There were parts about how internet security is important because the big government wants to spy on you, but also that if you don't have anything to hide, you shouldn't mind the police searching your car. At least they weren't consecutive parts of the rant.

There's probably other things he bitched about. I zoned out for parts of it. He kept at it until he noticed I was getting ready for bed, and he actually followed me into my room. He only stopped after I had taken my clothes off and was putting on my pajamas.

In any case, it was pretty eye opening. Before that, I kind of assumed that he was just an asshole to his kids and was nice enough to strangers. Turns out, he just keeps a veneer over his hatred for everyone else, and he's frustrated that he doesn't have anyone to talk to about it. Also, he's a hypocrite."

I don't find Tara Reade's accusations credible and this other stories are about him making people feel uncomfortable. But again he's abusing or harassing anyone. We've all known this for a long time. I wanted Sanders to the nominee but the rest of the country. This is who he get. You're article about him being a racist only says that he didn't admonish known racists and segregationist whom he worked with. Which I can understand. Politics in this country used to be more civil. 

Again, he wasn't my first choice and a lot could happen or be revealed between now and November that makes me not vote for him but as of now I am. These sources your giving me are the echo chamber. They're blowing things out of proportion. If he does something actually terrible I'll be right beside you. But for now he has my vote. 

Trump is also dangerous and will destroy the US if he has to. And he'll have to before his (god forbid) second term is up. And yes willing to vote for an imperfect candidate to defeat him."

2020-06-25 19:40:19,travelingunraveling,"I grew up with the midwestern nice attitude. Always polite to people, generally courteous, that high pitched helpful and accommodating voice came out whenever interacting with strangers. I’m also black and grew up being told I was one of the good ones, a model for my race, that I spoke so well, that I was pretty for a black girl, etc etc.

Once I became an adult and realized that no matter what I do, no matter how polite and accommodating I am, people will still see me and perceive me as black, and that will play out however they view blackness. So I began identifying as Black instead of biracial (I used to be very quick to tell folks I’m half white, I felt some shame in my blackness). Now I find pride in being black and have become a bit snarkier and speak with assertiveness. A lot of it is just through growing up, but I stopped caring about defying my Black stereotypes. I used to blast indie and pop punk to prove I’m not like the rest. Now I play what I want.

I guess it’s not me doing something bad, but after growing up the way that I did, it feels like I’m going against everything I was taught, so “bad” in that sense. Anyway."

Then 30/50% of the population was suddenly wiped out. The survivors found themselves in great demand and what was to prevent them from packing up and working for a different lord who paid more, or forsaking the land altogether and moving to the city?

The whole system fell apart and gave rise to the middle class, upward mobility, and the Renaissance."

EDIT: another example of how fucking stupid America is: maternity leave.

You offer people 12 weeks of UNPAID maternity leave. What fucking use is unpaid maternity leave to anyone? The literal only benefit that's offering anyone is ""oh hey, we won't fire you if you have a baby."" Most people wouldn't be able to afford 12 weeks off work. The best part, the 12 week rule only applies to companies with more than 50 employees.

In Canada, for example, you get 15 weeks PAID. So not only do you get more, but you can actually use it.

2020-06-25 19:38:45,b_wald81,"A gender swap doesn't automatically mean gender politics, and neither does gay couples.

For it to count as Gender Politics, you have to be making some kind of claim that one gender is superior to the other.

To use my Star Wars example again, having the main force-using protagonist be female isn't necessarily gender politics unless you *choose* to view it as such. Kathleen Kennedy going on TV with a shirt declaring ""THE FORCE IS FEMALE!!"", is very much gender politics.

Ghostbusters was just a shitty film. It had little to do with the gender-swapping of the characters, and everything to do with the fact they hired 4 of the funniest women in Hollywood and somehow made a dreadfully unfunny movie."

2020-06-25 19:38:34,JerseyJedi,"When I was in high school a bunch of us got to represent our school in a televised quiz bowl tournament (think Jeopardy, but with two opposing teams from different high schools in each episode) and we made it to the finale. Part of the deal was that we got to go to the studio of FUSE TV in New York to promote the finale. 

While we were waiting in the green room to go onstage, I had to use the bathroom. I went down a very narrow hallway to reach it, and along the way a pair of gothic-looking people (a guy and a girl) were walking in my direction. We met in the middle, kinda stared at each other for a moment, then I moved aside to let them pass. I went to the bathroom, came back to the green room, and found my classmates practically hyperventilating. 

It turns out that the gothic-looking pair were the Dresden Dolls, a popular punk band I hadn’t been aware of till then. The woman, Amanda Palmer, is now a popular solo act, from what I understand.

PS: when we eventually filmed the finale for the tournament, the show had a special guest come onstage to meet us: John Starks from the NBA."

Cardi B probably showed up to class maybe twice or 3 times the entire semester and was very chill for the most part. On the other hand, the Ziggy show dude was always hanging around in the cafeteria with his light skinned brother and all they did was holla at girls. He barely went to class and always goofing around in the student area. I remember when we used to make fun of him cos he always sits at this same spot everyday hollering at chics. But I don’t know if Cardi and Ziggy knew each other at the time but this was in our freshman year at a community college in NYC."

So one day she tells me to go hang out and grab food while I waited till she was off. Well little did I know it was a set-up and they just wanted to meet the girl who was very aggressive and sort of mean. As a giant teen wolf fan I was dying but played it cool. Got to talk to them for maybe an hour and didn't talk teen wolf because I felt weird.

A dear friend walked me to the train station, but had to go. I couldn’t find my ticket so I missed my train, and the next one wasn’t for a little while, so I went outside for a smoke to see if I could find the ticket. That’s when it hit me: I wouldn’t get to see my friend for God knows how long (I live in the States). I broke down in tears at the thought. A young lady approached me and sat with me while I finished my smoke, telling me it was going to be okay. She even helped me search my bag for my ticket, which we found. I’ll never take her kindness for granted. If I ever see someone crying alone I’ll pay it forward, and I hope you will too."

2020-06-25 19:37:07,BlueberryPhi,"I’d go on a tirade about listening to others, even and especially if you think their views are horrible, because doing so gives you the best chance at actually getting more people on YOUR side.

If you’re not willing to listen to your enemy, then why should they listen to you?  If you just silence them, they’ll still vote.

If a single nanobot can convert the surrounding matter into a duplicate of itself in a week, and the next week both convert matter into duplicates so you have four, then the earth would be soon overrun.  It’s the same principle with ideologies.  If your stance is so rational, why hide its logic from others with emotional shouting?  If your opponent’s stance is so obviously flawed, then hearing them explain it shouldn’t put you in any danger.

Most people, no matter what their beliefs, want to feel heard.  But nobody listens anymore, we’re just waiting our turn to talk, if we even bother with THAT.

If you want to be heard, you first have to listen.  Human beings are a bellcurve, not a series of columns.  That includes the other side.  Yes, they have crazies, so does your own side of the aisle if you’re honest about it!  Learn to speak to *people*, instead of rattling off in a contest of talking points!

Every idiot, fool, and bigot has, at the absolute core of their ideology, a nugget of actual wisdom they’ve built up from.  That doesn’t mean they’re right any more than a good foundation makes a house weatherproof, but it’s still there.  Seek to collect those nuggets of wisdom, learn from those you disagree with.  If wisdom is taken from only one source, it becomes stale and rigid.

I was trying so hard to see how he was doing his tricks but just couldn't. The *BEST* interaction was when I drunkenly said to him, ""Dude, you must get laid *ALL THE TIME*, you're really good at magic""

He laughed and said, ""Thank you, but that's not at all how magic works. I have yet to 'get laid' because of magic tricks even once"".

I thought to myself, must be doing it wrong. His slide of hand was so good that if he just turned to some babe and was like, ""I believe *these* are *YOUR* panties"" and handed em to her, she's got to be impressed."

2020-06-25 19:37:05,kchouichomp,"Don't perfect recipes, perfect techniques. That's the actual *best* advice. Other tips that significantly upped my game are:

Acid is your friend, keep a lemon and a few kinds of vinegar around.

Fuck iodized salt. Get some kosher and finishing salts.

Start poultry (and bacon) in a cold pan.

Good pans are worth it. Invest in one nice one if you can't afford a set. Same with knives.

Creme fraiche doesn't break in heated sauce, and has a way longer shelf life than cream. Also key for amazing scrambled eggs.

Salt your steaks and roasts well in advance, osmosis works. You can even leave it uncovered in your fridge overnight, which will dry the outside and give you a perfect sear every time.

Blanche and shock (where applicable) your veggies to keep their best color and eliminate timing issues.

Plating is extremely easy to learn! People are intimidated, but a nice spoon swoosh of puree, a ring mold for starches/veggies, and a square/rectangular plate can make your dinner look like it cost $50 a head.l, at the cost of an extra 30 seconds of your day.

Ditch nonstick sprays. Butter is a non-stick glue stick for baking (flour if necessary) and the super thin layer burns unevenly on your pans and can shorten the life of nonstick.

Last but not least, ignore the instructions on that frozen pizza. Throw that bitch into an oven preheated to 450°, right on the rack, and keep an eye on it. Trust me."

Suddendly he just reached over and grabbed my penis. I pulled back and asked him what the f*** he was doing. 
He stormed out and I didn‘t see him again.

In high school a girl I was dating whose best friend was dating Brendan Urie about 2 years before Panic at the disco got signed .... he showed up with his drummer but they hadn‘t even named their band yet ... But dude was hilarious..imagine the kid with add who just has the most awkward interactions with random people for the entertainment of his friends.... i ended up hanging with them after our girlfriends went home because we had a shit ton in common, both from Mormon families who We completely let down, i played bass but was more into the hardcore scene then the pop rock one .. but I didn’t really keep in touch outside of a few random AOL IM convos And he lived on the complete opposite side of town .. about 2 years go by and a different girl i was friends with had said Falloutboy signed her friends band off of one demo and they hadnt even played a show ..she showed me their myspace or whatever and I wasnt expecting to see his band there ...I reached out said Congrats and reminded him I slapped bass ( I actually had toured in A metal band Molotov Solution who was on A small indie label but eventually signed with metal blade and blew up pretty big in that scene so I tried to use that as a way into his band but they already had a bassist god damn it “ another year or so goes by panic is all over mtv blowing up and my best friends band is the big local thing in vegas ... They were called The Cab and somehow got their demo to the drummer i had met years prior and from him to Pete Wentz and then boom they were signed to fueled by ramen / Atlantic .. that summer Panic was writing their second album and rented a cabin up in Mount Charleston 45 mins outside of vegas and a member of  The Cab had a family cabin in the same area so in the day they’d write music and at night 50 kids would show up with hecka illegal substances of all varieties debauchery ensued ... Brendan was always cool as hell, he was a very generous individual back then with certain unsaid substances... if you want a clarification go compare their first 2 albums .. shit just the singles .. the second album single is called 9 in the afternoon.... listen to the chorus and if you are savvy I think you’ll catch on... We actually streamed Pink Floyd synced up to the wizard of oz from his macbook To a projector ....anyway  he’s a genuine dude, I havent seen him since, I’m glad hes been as successful as he is.. with all that said.... The Killers are the best band to make it out of this gorgeous trashhole of a town, never met Brandon Flowers though I know he’s super down to earth and apparently the imagine dragons guys are super cool too.. I guess Vegas isn’t so Bad after all."

2020-06-25 19:37:02,marimbello,"Drove three hours for an interview for my first teaching job. I was 23 and definitely didn't look any older. After the long drive, I went into a middle eastern restaurant in a strip mall for lunch...grew up in an area with lots of that cuisine and it's sort of my comfort food. The cook / owner spotted me, probably had no trouble reading the situation, and came over to chat. He hung out at my table - very few customers as it was an early lunch - and asked me about my professional interests and goals. It was like a warm-up interview. He also brought me a mug of warm milk with honey and a plate of baklava and promised me it would help me relax. The whole experience was like sitting in a grandparent's kitchen. He told me that if I got the job, he'd give me dinner on the house. His daughter taught elementary school in the district and he was able to give me some parting advice for the interview.

When I arrived, the school principal told me their German teacher had rescinded her resignation (what??) but that he was impressed by my application and had recommended me to a school 30 min away. By that evening, that second school had hired me. Sadly, this is all pre-GPS and I was pretty turned around by all the driving. Never found my way back to that restaurant."

I was 5'10 almost 5'11 so I brought all my fury down into the punch. He proceeded to get up and cry a few desks over. I get called to the principles office a class period later and don't get in trouble because I explained that he everyday would smack me as hard as he could which he admitted to doing. Now me and this kid had a home economics class in 3rd or 4th period and one kid asked why I wasn't talking to him because normally I would try to be nice. Well i said, ""Because he's annoying and I don't want to punch him in the face again."" Kid asks the little guy if I really punched him he says, ""It barely hurt,"" in front of everyone so I say calmly, ""Is that why you laid on the ground crying and went to the principle to snitch"" Everyone laughed and I am hailed as a hero of legends."

They trap you by controlling you, convincing you that they don’t like your friends and family so they make you cut them all off slowly but surely so you don’t have friends or family to help."

Occasional acts of mass violence are taken against hospitals and those who survived cancer from the cure.

2020-06-25 19:35:58,LookAtThisRhino,"&gt;Are they similar or completely different?

Completely different, but they all play an important part in making web content. Let's say you want to put a button on a webpage. Here is how each language can help you:

* HTML creates the button and puts it on the page
* CSS changes how the button looks, and *where* it looks (as in - is it always on the left, even when the user resizes the browser? or in the centre? is the button red? blue?)
* JavaScript will change what the button *does* (does it open a link? does it perform a calculation?)

HTML and CSS are barely programming languages. They really just specify properties of web elements like buttons and images, where they go, and how they look.

JavaScript is very much a programming language with functions, variables, and all the other things you'd expect from any other programming language.

Think of it like building a house. You could maybe make a real shitty house with just a hammer, but you'd be better off using a hammer, saw, drill, and other tools. Same applies to websites.

Here's some freehand code as an example using the button analogy above:

**HTML**

`&lt;button class=""coolButton"" onclick=""buttonClicked()""&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;`

**CSS**

`.coolButton {`

`background-color: #FFFFFF;`

`}`

**JavaScript**

`function buttonClicked() {`

`alert(""button was clicked"");`

This might look a little complicated but even without coding knowledge you can see a few things in the HTML. You're creating a button there, telling it to get its ""look"" from the coolButton section of CSS, and when it's clicked (""onclick""), call the JavaScript function buttonClicked().

I've left out some stuff but that's a good summary. The only real things left to do to make this work on a real webpage is to put the code into separate files, link them all together in the HTML (using script and stylesheet links), structure the HTML as a proper webpage, then you're good to go.

This gets more complicated as you go, too. Once you have a good grasp of the fundamentals, you should move on to learning one of the major web frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue. These frameworks add a few more layers on to your typical HTML/CSS/JavaScript, giving you the power to make some really impressive things. Facebook, for example, was built with React. Most of Google's online products were made with Angular. Upwork uses Vue, and Apple and Nintendo use it for a chunk of their online presence too."

Start my first week, starting at 1pm everyday. Go there and bring a lunch. Get in trouble for bringing food. We're not allowed to bring food because ""it'll attract mice"". Have to buy food from the store during my lunch (or really dinner).

Not allowed to use the bathroom unless it's during my ""lunch"" break.

If we're not ready to leave at exactly 9pm, we get screamed at since the employer didn't want to pay overtime or something. The store clean up is pretty strict and takes everyone solid hour to get the store &amp; deli cleaned up properly. The employer comes around with a black light to make sure nothing has been missed. Unfortunately his wife would come in 5-10 minutes before closing to do some shopping (including getting stuff from the deli). As she's walking away at 9pm after grabbing the food, the employer (her husband) would scream at us for not having the place cleaned yet and having to stay later. The place was clean but then his wife came and made us dirty the place back up.

The final straw was when I got my schedule and they had me starting in the morning. Just a reminder, I told them I couldn't work mornings. My next work day I tried my best but I was feeling too I'll to even get ready for work. I said fuck it, called them, and quit. Got a better job 3 weeks later."

why isn't it better? the problem you want to solve is you want to verify that ballots are counted as cast. this database lets an individual look up their own ballot. it does not verify the aggregate votes. secondly, the government counts the values, so the implication is a mistrust in the government to do so correctly and without falsification. instead of trusting this to the existing government run system, you want instead a different government run system. it will tell you you votes the way you know you voted, yes, but that doesn't verify that's how your vote is actually being counted.

why is it worse? this is an invitation for massive identity fraud and discrimination. anyone can look up any ssn? plug in a number, if it pops up you have a verified living human who lives in the district matching the local elections they voted in. secondly, your voting record is now a part of your personal information. it's tied with your ssn. it would be visible to your doctor, your employer, your insurance company, your bank, your school, your lender, your real estate agent, the hospital, the court, and the police. the secrecy of the ballot is an important constitutional right. this is a fantastically bad idea."

2020-06-25 19:35:29,finnjameson,"Yeah but the word literally had a different definition a few years ago compared to yours? I don't think it's as simple as gender has nothing to do with biology? Social constructs surrounding gender partly arise because of biological differences between men and women and to straight out say there two mutually exclusive things is uneducated. 

I'm not saying social norms shouldn't be challenged, of course they should. People who are being discriminated against for something like being trans, there sex or their race should be supported.

At the same time, you can't throw the baby out with the bath water. Science is very important to our society whether we like what it tells us or not, the most socially egalitarian countries in the world regarding sex is the Scandinavian countries, meaning they are currently the best at removing any social differences between men and women and more freedom of choice, this has lead to a bigger percentage of women choosing to be nurses and men engineers. The biggest personality differences in men and women is an interest in things vs an interest in people which reflects the job choices. The results insinuate by removing the social differences, you accentuate the biological differences in men and women. They are very relevant so saying biology has nothing to do with it is straight up ignorant, it at the very least is a base for gender identity. 

Also, could you expand further on what you meant by the morphology/physiology of the individual? 

I apologise if I have misinterpreted you here. If gender has to do with the changing of a person, what is changing? Their personality traits? What society expects of them? Physiology is listed as a sub-discipline of biological and is the study of functions and mechanisms in a living body?

I would like to finish by saying, I know gender dysphoria is a legitimate thing, I have sympathy for trans people being discriminated against. The gender stuff not having anything to do with biology being lumped in with it I don't agree with."

We're not even a plumbing business!!!! To top it off, we got shitty paper masks and were forced to ride 4 in a truck to the jobs in a crew cab work truck. 

Had enough of their shit so when they got on me one morning last week over some *bullshit*, I just walked off the job and quit. These are the type of people who just have to feel superior, so I got a letter a few days later saying I was fired. Thanks for that. Now I can file for unemployment."

Sure he did. He was convicted of willfully not paying taxes. He sought out and hired prominent ""tax protesters"" (people who believe the federal government has no authority to collect income taxes). 

&gt; He was getting robbed by his money manager 

That has nothing to do with his tax evasion scheme.

&gt; when he went to the authorities to report it

He offered a settlement for about 1/20th of his tax liability after he hired actual tax attorneys who told him he was completely screwed. When the IRS rejected his offer, he responded with hundreds of pages of every single possible agency and Constitutional argument money could buy.

&gt; Pretty messed up.

Multi-millionaire tries to avoid tens of millions in tax liability by hiring managers who publicly advertised themselves as tax evaders? Not messed up at all. A justified 3-year prison sentence. He's very lucky the jury let him off on the felony charges."

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I grew up with, went to highschool, and attended the same college as a LGBT personality (male, gay). Our families are still close to this day. He is a B/C list level celebrity probably more famous for internet/influencer but has been on a few basic cable shows and has a couple books. His entire “origin story” is 90% false and has put his career ahead of his family.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We’re from a small midwestern town in the middle of nowhere. He (repeatedly) tells a tale of how his parents weren’t supportive of him, everyone bullied and made fun of him for being ‘different’ and how horrible everyone in his life was until he moved to \[coastal gay friendly city\]. He claims his dad was abusive and threw him out of the house when he found gay porn on his computer. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is all 100% bullshit. The town he claims he ‘grew up in’ (didn’t have a \[fast food chain\], \[major retailer\]) is actually a smaller town in the same county. Its not the one we actually did grow up in. His parents spent all their time and a lot of money sending him to acting camps/workshops, community theater type stuff in cities that were hours away, and doing the preteen actor thing (he got a couple movie parts in \[large midwestern city by a lake\]). They paid for his four year college degree and financially supported him for years until he moved out of the state. They paid for the downpayment on his first house. They paid for his wedding. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

His dad, to my knowledge, never laid a hand on him and certainly never kicked him out of the house. Our families are extremely close and still are. I spent just as much time at his place as mine. If you’ve lived in a small town, you know its impossible for something like this to happen without everyone knowing. I’m sure coming out wasn’t pleasant or enjoyable, but no way was there abuse. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As for being ‘bullied’ – no doubt you were, but not for being gay. Dude, your senior photo was of you juggling in a David Copperfield outfit (aka the Seinfeld shirt). You did cringy monologues in the cafeteria. For one week, you wore an elf cloak and insisted people refer to you by your ‘elven name’. Nobody physically attacked you or beat you up. Everybody wondered what the hell was going on and if you needed help. It was there, but you kept pushing people away until they gave up trying to understand. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Every time I see a clip of him lying through his teeth, it makes me so sad for his parents. They still have a relationship, but its strained beyond belief. I know he’s never going to come clean because it would be the end of his influencer career. If you’re reading this, call your parents. Work through the issues. They’re not getting any younger."

2020-06-25 19:34:38,Taylor7500,"&gt; Brutality is the main issue,

And brutality is bad. But do you have any evidence that it's so widespread that the entire police force as an institution must be abolished, rather than being limited to a handful of assholes who should face justice?

&gt;If the problem is solved, it is in spite of the law &amp; law enforcement systems, not because of them.

That's a bold claim. 

&gt;Capitalism is abolished and hierarchies are flattened.

God, if only people had tried such a system before so we could see how it all turned out /s

But hey, at least you lose the right to complain if some right-wing folks call you a commie.

&gt;and we actually have systems in place to prevet crime instead of judt punishing it

We do. In fact within the last two years a fairly major prison reform bill was enacted to ensure that prisons are more about rehabilitation rather than punishment. 

&gt;The poor steal because they’re poor.

And people murder because they're....what?

&gt;For the first part of 2, violent revolution

Can't fault your willingness to use rights protected by the second amendment, but I will warn you the difference between a just reovlution and a terrorist cell is how popular they are, and I don't think you have the votes. Particularly among the gun owners.

&gt;Violence is necessary because peaceful protesting (allowing the oppressors to do you harm to sway opinion) doesn’t work in the modern day.

Citation needed.

But how about I have a go at presenting some evidence? One of us has to. There have been studies done on the matter. You won't like the results because [they find a lack of evidence for racially-motivated killings at a systematic level](https://www.cesariolab.com/police). Not overall, and not dependent on the race of the officer in question.

As for the whole ""police are oppressors with their boot on my throat"" thing you have going on over there, I'll ask you to cast your eyes over to Seattle. Over the past few weeks a group of your very own protestors decided to set up a self-proclaimed autonomous zone by driving out the police and being free to implement whatever law they wanted. And within those few weeks they had a higher murder rate than anywhere else in the world. And sure, that may be a quirk of the statistics on account of their relatively low population, but dozens of people stood around filming a guy bleeding out rather than trying to help him is not. In the absence of police, a third-rate rapper of all people grabbed a monopoly on power and assaulted and abused everyone around him. And I'm sure you're going to blame the lack of some community response here but the community was yours so an inability to implement whatever non-specific measures you think would have prevented this is a failure on your part and nobody elses."
2020-06-25 19:34:38,CertifiedBlackGuy,"I do not disagree with wearing a mask (I wear mine at work for 8 hours a day and when I go out), but I do feel like telling people to wear a mask is treating a symptom of a problem, not the problem itself.

You know what's better than wearing a mask in public? Staying home if you are sick.

The problem is for a lot of people, they might be out a significant portion of their paycheck if they stay home because they don't get paid sick time (or what they do get is woefully inadequate for a reasonable recovery or number of sicknesses in a year).

We should be telling people to wear a mask while also mandating better social safety nets for people. Getting sick shouldn't lead to a choice between losing a day of pay or infecting your coworkers."

She kept Saying all your parents are failures that’s why they brought you here you don’t deserve to be here and throwing stuff at him. He would just cry in the middle of class. so one time I just stood up walked over to her looked at her in the face said nothing and slapped her. Then I said shut-up don’t take your insecurities out on this kid. A couple other boys in the class gave me a thumbs up for what I did.

2020-06-25 19:33:34,trendz19,"I work as a merchant marine engineer on cargo ships. Work needs me to stay away from home 3-4 months at a time. (Junior ranks stay away much longer)

There didn't used to be any internet in ship and whatever stuff you need (movies, tv serial, documentaries etc) for entertainment, you usually carry on laptop or HDD etc

My HDD was 12 years old and had 80GB of total storage space. I wanted to copy one last tutorial on photo editing but didn't have the space. I didn't want to delete any existing photos &amp; video (from travel), so, decided to upload few of the videos on youtube which I made for a motorcycle website ownership forum. The videos were about how to reduce vibration in motorcycle, how to increase fuel efficiency and I think 1 more. All these videos were close to my heart and I didn't want to delete them. So I uploaded on youtube and left home next day to join ship.

I come back 6 months later (I was a junior then) and open my gmail. It is flooded with emails. Most of the emails are notification because someone commented on the video. Then I remembered the videos I had uploaded before leaving.

I visit youtube and find that these videos have got over 20,000 view in the last months! **This was the small event**

 I never imagined that I would have a youtube channel and that people would watch what I made! I never thought I would make friends on the internet in the process and maybe someday we would even meet. Never thought I had a *creative* side to me. Making videos is still just a hobby but enjoy it a lot and love to document my travels and life at sea in a way where it can help other travelers and sailors. Using the time, I taught myself video editing (by looking at free YouTube tutorials).

My video editing skills aren't *dope* by any means but slowly I have managed to grow a subscriber base of over 2250 people! Imagine 2250 people standing in group, it's a **BIG** number and they are all looking forward to watching something I [created](https://youtu.be/_NWFJlfGPEg)

This feeling is remarkable and none of this would have happened if I didn't upload the motorcycle videos. And guess what? Right now during lockdown when I have been without a paycheck for a while now, this youtube is helping support things! Okay, the money made there is still peanuts, but better than nothing and I am glad about that."

2020-06-25 19:33:21,SqueakyKeeten,"As a kid in the American south, some of this stuff gets taught to us in school even in the modern day.  In middle school, I literally had a history teacher who referred to the civil war as the ""War of Northern Aggression"".  We were taught about the ""state's rights"" narrative of the Civil War (conveniently ignoring that the only state's right in question was...slavery) and, while we discussed the horrors of slavery, there was a strange white-washing of the Confederacy as an institution.  There was always this paradoxical juxtaposition of the explanation of slavery as a horrific historical institution, while somehow framing the Confederacy, its people, and its leadership as ""freedom fighters"" struggling to safeguard their states against the tyranny of the ""Yankees"".

&amp;#x200B;

There is also the idea that flying the Confederate flag is a symbolic expression of determination, stubborn-ness, and defiance of authority that is seen by many in the South as virtuous."

My mom was clueless to who he was (even though I know she's watched SpaceBalls, Casper, Independence Day, etc.).  Bill and his son soon left and the guy who owned the Bead store next door came in and excitedly asked my mom how cool it was that Bill and his family were just there!  It didn't seem to bother her much--she was just happy to have a fun story to tell.  


On a different occasion, I was with my mom and a small business convention down in Vegas and John Rhys-Davies was there as a keynote speaker--he was also promoting the new LoTR movie.  After his talk he was sitting at a table chatting up the convention goers and I dared my mom to ask John to repeat the phrase ""Bad Dates"" (from Raiders of the Lost Ark).  John was awesome and he more than obliged: he acted a bit of the scene and dramatically delivered the line.  What a cool guy!"

Like we're some unpredictable wild animal that can't be let off the leash for a single moment because if let go even a little bit, it'll snap and attack whoever it encounters.

Like you have TV shows where people are dumped on some island and they have to figure out how to survive. These people are forced to work together because they're being filmed all the time. You wonder if it wasn't for all the cameras would these people too resort to violence and cannibalism. After all it only takes one person willing to resort to violence in order to survive and that forces everyone else into a situation where they either fight or cooperate to survive. Cooperation then only lasts as long as the last two survivors remain."

Ive listened to all 3 of his albums, both his mixtapes and other 3 projects he did or collabed with other artists like Quavo etc. Astro still comes out on top for me. I know some people like Rodeo more, or even Birds in the trap sing McKnight, but those who really do like those better understand why someone else likes Astroworld more. There are posers tho, who want you to believe that theyre an OG Travis fan and say that people who like something other than Rodeo are posers. If were talking about OG, if you were a fan since Owl Pharaoh came out, you have a right to call yourself that. Rodeo is still fairly recent.

2020-06-25 19:32:31,animell0w,"The Bjork Stalker.

Ricardo Lopez was an exterminator with aspirations of being a famous artist one day. He was very reclusive, insecure and lonely. He retreated into a fantasy world and became fascinated with the lives of celebrities, particularly the Icelandic singer Bjork. His fascination soon grew into an obsession and he began stalking her.

Upon finding out that Bjork was engaged to an African American celebrity by the name of Goldie, he became enraged about one, the fact that she was engaged and two that her fiance was a black man. He decided it was his mission to kill her or cause her some kind of physical and emotional harm as punishment. He began constructing a homemade acid bomb that he would mail to her house in London to disfigure or kill the singer. He also planned to commit suicide with the belief that he would meet Bjork in heaven where they could both be happy.

Lopez recorded his entire plan to kill Bjork and his motivations with a video camera and you can find the videos on YouTube. If you watch them you can actually witness his mental deterioration and descent into insanity.

Lopez sent the acid bomb to Bjork's house and then recorded himself shaving his head, painting his face red and green and then committing suicide by shooting himself through the roof of his mouth. His final words being, ""This is for you.""

Fortunately, the police investigated Lopez' apartment soon after his suicide and the FBI got involved. The package was intercepted by British authorities and the bomb was safely detonated in an isolated location.

Bjork is fortunately still alive and well.

The interesting thing about this case is that it provides an in depth look into the mind of a deranged stalker because of Lopez' recordings and is a creepy, heartbreaking and also quite fascinating psychological study.

If you're interested in looking more into the case, the link to a YouTube video that comprises of most of his video taped ramblings and his eventual suicide will be provided. I should warn you, it's quite disturbing.

There's no reason to think you won't connect well with your own child or an adopted child, but chances are a child with your genes could have an easier time connecting.

2020-06-25 19:32:05,Fysidiko,"I listened to an interview a while ago with the coordinator of the UK's national adoption program.

One of the things she was saying was that it was very important for people considering adoption to understand that it was very unlikely that you would get the 'perfect' little baby you might dream of.  Changes in society and use of contraception and abortion means there aren't many unwanted children born to otherwise healthy and 'normal' families, and so the vast majority of babies that are up for adoption have extremely complicated needs, such as the consequences of fetal alcohol or drug abuse, or serious disabilities.  Older children often have the same issues but might also suffer from the consequences of abusive parents.

She explained that this was the reason for parents looking to adopt from abroad under paid adoption programmes, but I suspect it is also one reason for people trying IVF rather than adoption."

2020-06-25 19:32:02,bbjoda,"My parents had me at 19 and got married because of it. Within two years, they had my brother. About ten years in, my dad cheated on my mom and they got divorced. It was never a happy marriage anyway but it really messed my mom up &amp; she started doing drugs, going out, having lots of men over, etc. we got evicted from our house &amp; moved in with my grandparents. My mom got pregnant again and we moved in with my sister’s dad. My mom cheated on him with multiple guys &amp; so we moved again. We got evicted again. It was a lot. She couldn’t hold down a job. She was unstable and manipulative. I babysat a lot to give her money for “groceries and rent” but it was drugs. She stole from us when we’d get Christmas money from our other family members. She took money from me that my grandparents gave me to go to camp one summer. She has always been so, so unstable &amp; volatile. 

My dad fought her for custody for years and finally won. It’s really messed up that it can be so hard for a father to get custody of his children. He wasn’t exactly stellar either, though. Much more stable, worked full-time, wasn’t an addict but he didn’t know how to help his traumatized kids and we never did any kind of therapy. 

I tell my husband all the time that it’s so weird to know I have parents but I never feel like I have parents. I’ve been on my own since I was 18 as far as living on my own, but I was pretty much responsible for myself since my parents’ divorce. My brother and sister really struggle with mental health issues &amp; it breaks my heart for them. I know it’s because they were neglected &amp; traumatized. I struggle with depression and anxiety but not to the degree that they wrestle with it.

I’m hoping to start my own lil family soon &amp; sometimes I get scared that I’m just going to mess it all up because I don’t know what a good mother is &amp; I’ve had to actively work through what I think good discipline is &amp; what is actually incredibly manipulative and damaging. I know what I don’t want to be, that’s for sure. I’m super thankful that I have a good, good man for a husband &amp; that it feels like I have control over my life now.

If you’re familiar with the ACE test (Adverse Childhood Experiences), my score is 8 / 10 which is... bad hahaha. But I am adjusted and successful in my own little ways and mostly I’m just happy to be where I am and to laugh a lot and to have friends and be a home-owner! I give a lot of credit to Jesus, for sure."

The mechanic works such that every bit of junk in the entire game has basic parts to it, and so in that little way, every single bit of junk is actually worth something. You can break it down into base parts, and use those parts for building shit. Like you can get copper out of old electrical shit, you can get steel out of scrap metal, you can get fabric from old rags.

Such a small change, but it's so deep and it feels so PERFECT for a game like Fallout. It just fits so well. The crafting mechanic overall becomes so much better with that little mechanic change."

2020-06-25 19:31:13,Narshwrangler,"1) Had a math teacher in 8th grade; Algebra I, she was strict and many of the students didn't like her, but I knew she was nice because my older brother had had her a couple years prior. Well I'd just found out that my parents were divorcing and that was a big blow for me at that age (messy divorce, too) and I was struggling with the early stages of depression. So one day, because of an issue with my ADHD meds, I suddenly couldn't read the numbers on my worksheet. Then I couldn't read the numbers on the board. I started hyperventilating because I had always been one of the strongest math students in my grade and for me to not be able to solve a fairly simple equation was an alien feeling. My buddy and friendly math rival was sitting beside me and could tell something was wrong. He tried to walk me through the problem by breaking it down to the point where he was asking me ""what's 6 + 3"" and I kept panicking and saying ""I don't know, I don't know, I don't know!"" It wasn't long before my teacher and the rest of the class noticed that I was weeping and having a panic attack at my desk. She paused the lesson and calmly said, ""Narshwrangler, please pack up your things and go down to guidance."" I had thought she was upset with me for disrupting her lesson, but as I was leaving the room I overheard her saying to the rest of the class in a very stern voice, ""now I want to make this clear; nobody in this room saw anything that just happened. This does not leave this room."" And the only time I ever heard anyone mention that incident again was when my buddy who had been sitting beside me asked me the next day if everything was okay and if I wanted to talk about it.

2) Precalculus teacher in 11th grade. Another strict teacher, but this time I didn't like her either. I had begun the year trying to get off my Concerta medication and the withdrawal caused me to be borderline narcoleptic. I would fall asleep in every class every day. This pegged me as a ""bad student"" in the eyes of my teachers, plus I never did the homework. However, I would still always ace my math tests because that's just how my brain worked when it came to math. One day a few months before the end of the year (and back on my medication), my Precalc teacher tells me I'm at risk of failing (again) for not turning in any homework and that if I want to pass I have to stay after school with her to complete the worksheets. I reluctantly agree and meet her after school in the classroom. We probably did about 15 minutes of math and then 2.5 hours of talking. She got basically my whole story; from the ADHD meds, to the divorce, to issues with my parents and siblings, etc. She told me it was starting to make sense because her two kids (now in college) both struggled with ADHD and had a similar aptitude when it came to not studying or anything, but still *learning* the material well enough to ace the tests. She made a deal with me where I would only have to do half the assigned homework problems, but I still had to turn the assignments in. I passed with a fairly good grade (good enough to get into AP stats the following year if I wanted to) and she even gave me extra time on my final exam that she wasn't supposed to. She also became one of my strongest supporters when it came time to get into college and hugged me so tight when I came to visit after my first year of college and I told her how well I was doing. She is one of the biggest reasons I even made it into college in the first place.

TL;DR strict math teachers are the only reason I survived school."

Ive been in abusive/toxic relationships and been cheated on several times, there is no valid reason to cheat on someone other then being a bad person and always having those urges and thoughts.

Theres a reason the saying ""a cheater will always cheat"" holds true, if they do it once theyll do it again regardless of if they get caught or not, sorta like drug addicts, how theyll say things like ""ill stop"" or ""i wont do it again after today"" but then a week later theyre back at it again."

I think it really depends on the level of attraction one has to the person. Higher level of attraction —-&gt; higher level of enjoyment. 

Then there are those situations when one wants to actively avoid the feeling (close relative falls in this category for me). 

Is it a bit pervy? Yeah, but the big brain isn’t always leading the mind and where thoughts linger to. 

More importantly there is the “accidental elbow score.”  This is when a woman comes up to you from behind, places a hand on your back and leans in to tell you something and her boob(s) presses into your elbow area. Now, this may not be intentional, but it’s certainly more noticeable then a hug because it’s less expected to happen."

I could feel a crack stating on the inside of the bottle and feel it was about to crack open. A classmate saw me throw away a almost half full bottle and asked me if I really just threw away a half full bottle and why. For some reason I just told him I did not want it anymore and not tell him the bottle is about to burst. It was quite something to see him trying to deal with half a bottle of correction fluid cracking open and spilling all over his workbook and desk. Have to add that he was always bullying people as well so I did not feel bad at all.

One day I'm clearing out the drains in the low point between two of the fields.  It hadn't been done in some time so I had to slice through six inches of grass, dirt, and mud to get to even see the concrete culvert at all.  Make a square with my shovel, pull it out, toss it to the side, repeat.  

A guy who I got along with fairly well and a couple of his friends came up and he started giving me a hard time.  I ignored him for a couple of minutes until I just snapped. I threw the latest cube of muck straight into his chest, actually knocking him back a couple of steps.  His buddies saw the big square of mud in the middle of his shirt and laughed their ass off.

Watching an episode of NBC's ""Ed"" back in the day I'm thinking ""what the hell has this girl done before.. she looks so familiar.."" one IMDB trip later, boom.

Numbah 2. Same school There was a girl Mary a year behind me who had a younger brother in the lower school. One day this kids racing through the halls with a guitar and I'm going ""that kid thinks he can play"". One day I'm reading a copy of SPIN going ""Where have I heard this last name. sounds so familiar"" BOOM. Andrew Van Wyngarden of MGMT.Also of note was a kid who's parents worked at the school. One was guidance counselor, other was Biology teacher. They actually lived on campus. This kid, then a senior, builds a cyclotron (atom smasher) out of like 2x4's and microwave parts. Garage built, though technically they didn't have a garage. Wins the world science fair that year, interviewed by local shock jocks on a morning radio show who called him ""cyclotron boy"".

needless to say I only spent two years there before going back to public school. Still very bitter about things that went down, but at least I can say I had a brush with some greatness. Oh and the school is now three times the size!"

The police had actually stopped them once and let them go because they were hell bent on finding the mythical ""white van.""

The DC sniper case was solved in spite of the police rather than because of them.  Every day, Chief Moose would be on TV meeting the ridiculous demands of the snipers like making absurd statements.

I'm only aware of him and his giant because they're sitting across from me behind my date. All of a sudden Pitt gets up and walks over to my table, says hi and asks what we're up to. 

I tell him we're just having a drink in a friendly but non-enaging way (I don't need some friendly drunk dude crashing my date). He seemed a bit sad, smiled and excused himself back to the bar. Then left shortly after.

Immediately the bartender excitedly comes rushing to our table asking if we know him and what he told us. Then tells us who he is. We still had no idea who he was, then she told us about the movie Ghost in the Shell, and Boardwalk Empire.

Unlike the American flag, which represents some negative actions as a country but not a negative principle overall, both the Confederate and Nazi flags represent at their core a founding principle that most would consider negative (pro-slavery and fascism, respectively). So despite how a minority of people interpret it, it doesn’t change history. Given that, are you also fine with people flying the Nazi flag if it represents something different to them personally?"

Its not that hard to imagine automated fabricators in the not to distant future capable of assembly advanced technologies from design files, that the operators know nothing about. Even fabricators that could build copies of themselves, with some minimal assembly required. 

An advanced alien race interested in promoting trade, could see an advantage in spreading the technologies required for interstellar travel and trade, while withholding most other technologies, lest the younger races grow to threaten them. And if the ""magic box"" fabricators build all the high tech parts of the ships, most of the rest of their tech could be very far behind. Actually, if they were also given the Iron Age tech needed to build the rest of their ships, when their society was no where near the the point of making such discoveries on their own, their institutions of science could be totally unprepared to do anything with the tech. Tale a WWII tank, and bring it back to 1800s Europe or the US, and its analysis by scientists and engineers would have advanced science and technology by leaps and bounds. Take it back to 6000BC Ancient Egypt, and I'm not sure they would have been able to get much out of dissecting it. Likewise, the recipients would need a certain level of science and technology to be equipped to start reverse engineering advanced alien tech they traded for..."

I bought into it for a few months. The first wrinkle came when they told me if I played Pokémon or read Harry Potter I'd be going to hell. At the time I was obsessed with both.

But the defining moment was several months later, when I decided to have the pastor pray for me - not because I felt I needed it, but because I was getting very jaded and decided to put his Benny Hinn powers to the test.

The pastor pressed on my temples so hard and kept pushing me backwards. Ended up doing kind of a Matrix bend as he tried to get me to be ""healed"" or whatever it was. I never fell, but I had a wicked headache afterwards.

By that time I had gotten my mother into the church and she would keep me going every Sunday, but the faith was long gone.

-  if you have any means of making a log of the abuse and storing it somewhere that is safe, do it. However you should be 100% sure that it is hidden somewhere your abuser cannot find it as you'd potentially put yourself in worse danger. 

- if you have someone you trust and the means to do so, have them squirrel away money for you.

- no matter what you are made to believe by your abuser, you do NOT deserve what is happening to you. Take all the love you are throwing at them and give it to yourself. Let that build up inside you until you are strong enough to get out.

I plead with anyone who witnesses a domestic incident to contact the police. Don't ignore it. You here someone screaming at their significant other through the walls of your apartment or notice a domestic incident of any kind outside your window - report it. I know for a fact my old neighbours must have heard my sobbing, the screaming and shouting, smashing and crashing around. One phone call would have put it on the system and helped to corroborate my word in court. Unfortunately this was not the case, people didn't want 'to get involved' so they turned a blind eye to it. My abuser laughed their way through court because they had been so clever and covered their tracks throughout the relationship. Your report could ultimately enable a victim to become a survivor."

Yeah, oatmeal raisin with a decent amount of spice and brown sugar (instead of white sugar) is an excellent cookie. Oatmeal chocolate isn't as good, less flavorful. Chocolate oatmeal-chocolate chip (where you add a lot of cocoa powder to the cookie dough) is really good though.

One time at the end of grade 6 I walked into the class and they were playing truth or dare and one of the dares was to kick the class’s computer. And they did. A kid got empowered by that and grabbed a chair and smacked the board and pealed the plastic off. 

Another we threw a water bottle at the projector and made the screen turn purple. The color would creep from the top left and cover the whole board and then retreat. 

Another time we shoved screws into the door and locked our teacher outside and had free periods for about an hour. They eventually removed the lock. 

And on the school bus we used to get cassette tapes and unwind them and throw the plastic outside the bus and keep it trailing behind us for the whole trip. 

And one time we got water balloons on the bus and threw them at the students who were leaving. Good times. 

And there was also the science fairs I did with my best friend and the end of year parties and the piñata I made.

2020-06-25 19:29:08,generallyavid,"Depends. Some girls curve their back outward as much as physically possible so the shoulders touch you and nothing else.

In a normal hug you can feel it. Clothing makes a big difference. Given both huggers wear equally thick clothing, a thick jacket can hide their appearance. A shirt with no bra can possibly tell us the location of your nipples.

How it makes me feel?
It gives me a sense of trust/acceptance, if i get hugged without a curved back. It can be weird if your drunk aunt, that's far too old for your taste, clenches you between her breast and arms for minutes.
But most of the time it's something nice.

So after I smoked my second grav, I went outside and coughed my lungs up and then went back in and sat down. At the time i was an atheist, but I started thinking about god and hell and started freaking out. And my friends were saying stuff, but I couldn't comprehend what they were saying. So we went into my friends room, and I sat on the bed and had an intense trip and had thought loops, and the same sequence happened for 8 hours straight. Then I snapped out of it and I jumped out of the bed. Btw the hole time I was in the loop, I thought I was in hell/ the afterlife. And I cussed out my friends, because I thought they gave me laced weed. And the next day I had flashbacks in the middle of class. I legit thought I was still in the sequence for 2 months straight. I was on antidepressants, and antipsychotics. I went batshit crazy, but as I got used to the frequent flashbacks, and now I am diagnosed with HPPD, and I am a Christian.

Brain scans of trans people are more similar to cis people of the same gender. And a source of physical dysphoria can be that the brain expects nerve endings to be in certain places on the body when they are not.

When you talk about changing gender, you might be thinking of gender expression (clothes styling and so on)

For sex, a popular talking point is that chromosomes cannot be changed, while true, chromosomes are among the least relevant sexual features for daily life. 

Hormonal sex has a massive influence on various parts of the body making it more similar or identical to the target sex (which can be male, female or somewhere in between):

fat distribution, muscle mass, skin, hair, scents, risks for some medical conditions or cancers, amount of hemoglobin in the blood (affecting stamina) etc. etc."

2. The potential Biden presidency-read below.

Biden would make a great president. He’s particularly strong on foreign policy. He has an incredibly deep well of experience. Trump has done serious damage to our foreign relations. This is a uniquely difficult time in the world, with democracy under threat from the rise of authoritarian nations and Trump has sided with dictators and has isolated us from our allies. Biden knows these leaders. He has spent time with these leaders. More than that, he truly understands the importance of NATO and democracy promotion. He understands that the actions taken in the next four years could likely determine the course of this century in human rights and global affairs. He is particularly strong on China. Biden has spoken with passion on the treatment of the Uyghurs and will make human rights an important issue in US-China relations, as it should be. He is the only candidate with a detailed plan for responding to a potential Chinese invasion of autonomous Hong Kong. He supports reviving something similar to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but with more worker’s rights protections and anti-outsourcing measures to create a powerful trading block of Pacific democracies to compete with China, and he has stated a willingless to consider options up to and including sanctions and economic isolation to pressure the Chinese government. He knows that a strong America is good for the world, and that the world’s democracies must unite to combat the tyrrany and corruption of nations such as Russia, China, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. He supports using our considerable soft power, I.E. diplomatic influence, to push for justice. This is also the only true path to lasting peace, as democracies don’t go to war against other democracies. He rightly has strong reservations about using our military to solve problems that do not have a military solution or could be solved through diplomacy. He strongly opposed and argued against President Obama’s troop surge. 

Outside of foreign policy, he has the longest and strongest record of actually passing progressive legislation. He wrote the Violence Against Women Act. He helped pass the Assault Weapons Ban. As Vice President, he got our troops out of Iraq, pushed Obamacare through congress, helped negotiate the Iran Nuclear Deal, and was instrumental in various budget negotiations. He has deep relationships on Capitol Hill and the experience to get his proposals passed. He will add a public option, which will help put us on the path to a single payer system, which I support as the eventual goal. He will make the United States a global leader on climate change, creating thousands of new jobs. He will push for justice on issues from race to LGBT rights and more. He will appoint judges who understand that the constitution guarantees our rights, including the right for women to make their own decisions about their bodies. 

Furthermore, I would also posit that, in such uniquely challenging times in the world, now more than ever we need to elect a candidate who knows how to restore our standing in the world, and also that as the president has a particularly large amount of control over foreign policy that this issue is especially critical in the presidential race, as opposed to congressional races, which are less important for foreign policy. Take health care. Let’s say that you support enacting medicare for all immediately. electing a president who supports that does not ensure that that would get passed by congress, while electing a president who supports a public option instead does not ensure that negotiations with congress won’t result in medicare for all instead. The president has the power to sign and veto legislation, urge congress, and push for their positions. On foreign policy, though, electing a president who, let’s say, opposes making human rights a focus of U.S.-China relations almost certainly assures that they won’t be, while electing a president who supports that almost certainly assues that they will be. 

Also, it’s what people do when they think that no one is watching that provides the best view of their true nature. Biden’s true nature shows that he cares about people more than pretty much any politician. Here’s an example of what he does when he thinks that nobody is watching. From the very beginning of his political career, every time he ran for anything, this woman in Delaware would send him an $18 check. Not that long ago, she died. Joe was reading the newspaper and saw her name in the obituaries section. He had never met her, but he felt compelled to pay his respects. He went for a shiva call (Jewish mourning practice). There were no cameras, this was not a public relations stunt, and Joe never mentioned it. The story was brought to light by her rabbi. 

Finally, Biden understands that America has rarely, if ever, lived up to anything anywhere near the lofty ideals that we hold, but he understands that there was a sense of pride and unity, optimism and determination, and idealism that has been lost. He wants to restore that, but as an inclusive vision that actually lives up to our aspirations and leaves no one behind. This is quite possibly our last chance to recapture that knowledge of what America can be, that vision of what our destiny can be, that was advanced by such figures as John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, Frank Church, and Walter Mondale. Restoring that vision in the next few years could ensure it’s survival, while I fear that failing to bring that vision back now will mean that it could be gone forever. No one else running focuses on much beyond their individual policies. Many say they can unite us, but no one provides the unifying vision that we had, that we need. This is what makes America special. This vision is Joe Biden’s vision
(From his website)-Joe’s Vision:

“We are in a battle for the soul of America. It’s time to remember who we are. We’re Americans: tough and resilient. We choose hope over fear. Science over fiction. Truth over lies. And unity over division. We treat each other with dignity, we leave nobody behind, and we give hate no safe harbor. We are the United States of America. And together, there is not a single thing we cannot do.”

Joe also states on his website, “Our best days still lie ahead.” Let’s elect someone with the experience, tenacity, and vision to make this statement a reality. It’s not yet too late. If we work together, we can do it."

Around 11 years old a new kid shows up. He's there less than a week and he's been getting picked on, so he decides the way to be cool is to pick on me. He approaches me and starts yelling things about my sexual orientation and about supposed lewd acts with my father. Stuff that was way past the line of what the other kids had ever done.

As someone used to being picked on, I didn't really respond. But when he just didn't stop I just decked him. Never had been in a fight before, but he ended up on the gym floor crying his eyes out.

It went down a pretty dark path and I said fuck it to just about any positive or productive thought. I started drinking daily and smoking pot too much. (I still love pot but it was abusive). I abandoned my instincts to try and fit in with a group of people I didn’t even like. If it was bad for me I said yes, if it was good for me I abstained. I would get pissed drunk and go for a drive, in hopes I might hit a tree and save myself the embarrassment of failing at suicide. I think that way of living is basically a slow and steady suicide. If I carried on that way I might not be here today. I’m glad I climbed out of that dark pit. Not sure if this was the type of “bad” you were expecting.

Then the night came where he decided to drag his bogan friends with him into the house, where we lived as 4, at 2 am and start a fucking Texan dance in the living room. I'm not exaggerating when I say that the whole house vibrated from 8 people stamping (not sure that's correct English?) on the floor.

Anyway, I told them to fuck off, he screamed at me, I screamed back and he threatened me, how I dare talk to him like that.

When he was sober the next morning, I told him it was the last time he threatened me, that neither him nor I wanted this to happen again.

Well, not 2 weeks later I had a screaming and threatening Texan in the house who I tried several times to calm down and pushed away but he wouldn't have it. 

Ended up with him on the floor, me choking him and telling him repeatedly to stop, then I'd let him go, which he didn't. If not someone wouldn't have finally intervened Idk what would've happened.

He filed a police report immediately of course which he dropped 2 days later.

But because of modern technology that allows us to have clean water, cleaning supplies like soap, and buildings to live in that are secure and can help us be exposed to less harmful things, the need for foreskin to help protect the penis is pretty irrelevant now. Therefore, the amount of skin that is on the penis that isn't needed would be an uneeded ""extra"" compared to those who have been circumcised. Does that make sense?"

It was an interesting game. It was like a feudal china MMO. There were like 8 different kung fu schools and you joined one to learn kung fu. You leveled up by doing these DDR style group dances (think like the training scenes in a kung fu movie where all the students do moves in unison). The combat was almost like a fighting game. The movement was a lot of fun you could get the ability to run on/up walls or on water, lots of real crouching tiger hidden dragon stuff. It was also a fully PvP sandbox, which means you'd have these organic encounters that start as small scale scuffles or ganking and gradually turn into an all out brawl. Overall it's some of the most fun I've ever had in a video game. Sadly despite all the good it had it was also very flawed in many ways as well as having all the problems you'd find in the average freemium Korean MMO. If it's still around its heavily P2W.

2020-06-25 19:27:45,My-cats-dont-shut-up,"My school went on a field trip, and I thought I was going to alone the entire trip because I had just gained enough confidence to ditch my toxic friend.

When we arrived at the museum my school was suppose to hang out for around 2 hours, I was just standing in a crowd of school mates that had all paired up in groups. 

Somebody I had been previously friendly towards offered to allow me to join their group, I accepted and ended up staying with them for the entire trip, and befriending everyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Somebody just showing me an little bit of kindness was enough for me to finally start accepting myself, and learning that people liked me because I was just me.

&amp;#x200B;

It's corny but if she never cared I would've probably gone back to my toxic friend, now I realize that most of freaking school actually cares about me and I have a lot of people I can talk to. It's stupid but its made me more confident in myself, I've managed to kick moat of social anxeity in its ass and become more open and able to publicly speak without shame. 

&amp;#x200B;

You might think someone whose lonely doesn't want pity, empathy, or sympathy, but trust me we do. When you invite us to hang, and actually include us it feels real nice, even if most people don't voice it. Pitying someone isn't bad, but if you do it than I hope your treating that person like a fecking person, nobody really wants to a pity king, or a lonely nobody."

He played Jesus when the church did Stations of the Cross, which involved him being stripped down significantly at one point in from to the whole congregation. I was an awkward 13 year old girl when that happened so you can imagine my girlfriends and I definitely talked about this. Ever since then whenever he pops up in a role I find myself saying, “Hey, it’s the Hot Jesus guy.” Which I probably shouldn’t do, because I know Jesus was definitely not a blonde-haired white boy."

They managed to find exactly the right method where the animals could emote and move in interesting ways, while maintaining some semblance of natural looks.  And given that the original movie is garbage, and the remake is based more closely on the book, I'd say it turned out pretty well.

The rest are all shit, though.  I recommend you watch ""I just Can't Wait to be King"" or ""Be Prepared"" from the live-action Lion King, so that you can gain an appreciation for just how awful it is."

He was the type of person who was already the master of everything without trying. He was in amazing shape. He motivated everyone around him to be and do better in their lives. He was smart and funny and charming. If he performed a ridiculously amazing feat on a Monday, you'd be waiting around on Tuesday to do another one because amazing feats were his wheelhouse. His only downfall was his girlfriend. She was gorgeous, but he was depressed and she very often used that against him. She'd push him to the edge and when he was threatening to kill himself, she told him to do it.

None of us really knew this until it was too late. Most of our friends only saw them on their good days, and the few who did know how bad things were did what they could to get him out of the abusive relationship, but to no avail.

In the end, the girlfriend had moved out and was dating a married man. That married man was also friends with J. It is my opinion that they teamed up on him and made his life even worse. It absolutely fucked my faith in humanity. Every day on this earth without him is a day that could have been a million times better. We lost a fucking literal miracle worker due to the horror of depression and post traumatic stress. He didn't have to die, and his girlfriend and the married man who pushed him toward suicide are the lowest pieces of shit on this planet.

I'm saying if he didn't want it to be about him, he wouldn't put himself in the position to draw attention away from the team and toward himself. Like you said yourself, he knows that will be the case. The team does, too. That's why they made him an ambassador. That's the whole point of that whole thing, to use his fame to boost support for the team. 

And he wants the boost in his public presence and to be associated with/support his team. If he didn't want it, he wouldn't do it. I don't see how pointing that out is offensive to you to the point that you think it's hatred. 

The fact that I'm not a fan of his music doesn't even factor into my evaluation of the way he markets himself. And even then, wouldn't it make more sense if I was bothered by the people that like being pandered to than someone who is simply taking advantage of that?

Some will fight to the bitter end of course, but contrary to the media’s list of bogeymen, the Right doesn’t have any sizable organized resistance movement. The Left already controls all the institutions, as well as social media.  When things get more dire, the left will be able to go after the Right’s best organizers and leaders before they even have a chance to form a sizable following.  That’s how the Tea Party movement magically disappeared before the 2012 election."

It gets increasingly annoying for others when I have to ask them to please repeat what they've said if they don't speak up. It makes me frustrated and embarassed when meeting new people but people I know naturally adjust to speaking in a louder tone when in my presence. Helpful tips would be to encourage others to speak up when talking and try facing the person with hearing damage so you'll be able to read from their face what you can't hear. Luckily, I'm an introvert so meeting new people isn't really often for me. Plus, I prefer texting over talking so it makes everything easy."

So, someone can feel more male than female, more female than male, not really either, or both. I identify as female and I tend to dress as what I consider femininely. Sometimes I wear my husband's clothes, but I still identify as female. So it isn't just about the outward appearance. It can be expressed through the outward appearance but doesn't have to be. You can feel like you're more feminine or more masculine. Say a woman feels more masculine. She can still identify as female. It's all personal. It has nothing to do with biological sex or sexual orientation."

This is you projecting a straw man position that I do not hold on to me, and then arguing against it.

Then his clone-brother dies to an anti-clone virus but he himself doesn't for some reason.

The brother-clone's arm gets grafted on the arm-stump of a Russian-American triple- (maaayybe quadruple-)agent and somehow the personality of the arm's original owner invades the graftee, and some blond ~~closeted gay dude with a Beard who bitches a lot~~ former child soldier  -- who was raised by a *third, secret brother-clone*, ***and was the president of the motherfucking United States of America*** -- fights against his adoptive father and Mr. Infectious Personality (initially under the orders of an AI made by a shadow government that's basically the modern Illuminati).

OG clone protag gets old fast and fights against brother/old fart Dragonball fusion some more until he finally ACTUALLY kills him. Then he finds out his dad is actually kind of a cool dude, was secretly influencing major events since the 70's or 80's, and sought to destroy the shadow government. Protag unwittingly played right into his plans all along and helped bring about the end of said government.

And by the way, the original time OG clone fought and killed his dad... yeah, that was a mentally-conditioned, involuntary-plastic-surgery-patient pseudo-clone of Papa Warlord who was used as his public persona while the real dude worked in the shadows and kept in hiding. And Ultimate Warrior Dad, his clones and pseudo-clone, and Whiny Badass all have/had snake-related names or pseudonyms at some point in their combat careers... for some reason."

2020-06-25 19:26:07,TammieBrown2020,"I have a lot of mixed feelings about this. I don't want to actually ""destroy"" capitalism, but I do favor heavily-regulated capitalism that, at least by the standard in the US, would be considered ""socialist"".

I say it because capitalism, or the way we do it, has fucked with people a little bit. I don't like that we have people who can't afford healthcare, education, or other things they might need to have better lives, while also having money and wealth becoming more and more concentrated in the hands of a very few. I don't mind markets, but the trickle-down idea of money has just not materialized the way people said it would. All ships don't rise with the tide, and I feel like that's a bad thing. 

Capitalism puts profit ahead of human well-being. If you have to fuck over the environment, or people's employment benefits, or even their employment in general to maintain that profit, you do it. The interests of shareholders get priority over the interests of other people who might be more directly hurt by it.

This was rambly, but I don't really trust unwatched and uncontrolled market capitalism. I like innovation and creating opportunity, but that can't come at the cost of other people."

1.  Highly intelligent / hard-working.  Working as a high-powered surgeon or lawyer, broker, or startup owner type.  These people are just the 1% of 1% of intelligence.  They will win wherever they go.  If they go military, they become tier 1 operators and later generals/admirals.  If they go to industry, they become an exec.  If they go into private practice, they become reputable as the best and can charge the most.


2.  Highly Lucky.  Right place at the right time, had the right certifications for an exploding market, had rich parents, or just straight up won the lotto.  These people's wealth is usually temporary.


3.  Highly disciplined.  This is probably the category with the overwhelming majority of high net-worth individuals.  People who spend less than they make, and invest.  Over time, the snowball grows massively.  Someone disciplined, making an average household income, saving an appreciable % of their annual income, will likely become a millionaire within their lifetime."

I wasnt doing anything with him against him and he started making fun of me so i go with my reusable shopping bag with all the snow clothes i had (boots pants coat gloves ski mask etc) and just smacked his dumb ass with it, he started saying he did nothing wrong and that i was being mean to him, then i called my mom and she started giving me a guilt trip and when i told my best friend and the big reason im still here(hes the one who knows my mental state outside of me the best) and he was doing the opposite trying to make me feel good about my decision, which i admit wasnt the best choice i could have made but when youve repressed your emotions for 3 fucking years and have a bag with snow boots a snow coat and a pair of snowcoats near the person who almost made you commit suicide multiple times in the past 3 fucking years you dont make good decisions (although i dont normally anyway)

I think Juneteenth is great... for Texas. This all falls under the category of precedent. Over time, other states will also want national holidays for their specific achievements or overcoming something. Then it dips into other classes and other races and then there’s so many random holidays that they no longer mean anything because “it’s just another day”.

So a while ago, like with PLENTY of notice, I requested July 2nd off so me and my family could go to the beach and have a 3 day weekend (my work days are Sunday-Thursday’s). I’ve only ever requested one other day off in the 6 months I’ve been at my job, I have never been late once, I have never called out—sick or otherwise. I will come in early, I will stay late, I will work on my days off, etc. I’m a very good caregiver and a very good employee.

Anyway. I saw the schedule for July and they did not give me the 2nd off. I requested a meeting with the scheduler and she told me I basically didn’t make the cut, she couldn’t give everyone the days off they requested. I was pissed. I told her everything I stated above and told her I wasn’t asking *permission*. I was notifying them that I wouldn’t be there that day, and I told her just so you know, I will not be there that day, don’t expect me to, don’t plan on it, and I don’t care if I get written up, but it better not be for a no call no show, because I’m tellin ya right fucking now with PLENTY of notice lol.

She was texting me this morning and saying she would give it to me if I came in and worked the 4th. I said no, I’m going to be out of town, so that doesn’t work. Again holding firm. I got what I wanted lol she said she’d give me the day.

It is a bit like dowsing, and essentially one is querying the unconscious mind. While there is nothing Magic about it, there are very odd effects that can happen over time.

I posed a serious of questions that led to a conversation of sorts with this guy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Locke_(composer)  I have since read his book and collected a bunch of his music. Even if the process isn't quite what it seems, this was still a worthwhile outcome and has value.

It too long ago to remember the questions, but basically it starts with narrowing down a timeframe and place and focusing in with all subsequent questioning.

It's all a bit predictable when you break it down, but during a session it sure feels real and like a discussing is taking place across time and space.

Once in a blue moon I will ask the pendulum something specific and see if it matches my intuition. It always does."

She recently went to one of his smaller standup shows here in Des Moines and during a meet and greet she said he did recognize her though it had been decades. He told her she was mentioned in a few of his earlier acts though not that night. (She hopes they were positive mentions, but comedians usually roast people so she didnt want to dig into it and be sad that people laughed at her expense)

Imagine having to FORCE yourself to concentrate on the SIMPLEST tasks, like sitting still or paying attention to someone, while your brain is YELLING at you to move around, fidget, do something other than the task at hand.

When it comes to having a conversation with someone or trying to make friends, that's also hard when you have ADHD. You sometimes miss subtle social cues or important details in a conversations because you got distracted by something going on in the background, which can cause the other person to get upset with you."

Nobody has the right to set limits on how others express their feelings as long as they're being expressed peacefully. Those feelings should be espoused and a dialogue should be started, that's how we get mutual understanding and change. ""Canceling"" people and otherwise ostracizing their views from the public causes them to recede into echo chambers that build anger, resentment, and ultimately lead to an explosion of expression through violence. You know what every reformed racist has in common?

They've spent their entire life being offered alternate history and pro-confederacy talking points as facts. Those figures truly are only seen as people who loved the south so much they were willing to do anything to protect and defend it. My uncle was lucky because his best friend is black, so he just called his friend and asked him to be brutally honest about his opinion with the statues. He was able to hear the other side of things without being screamed at or accused of racism. He doesn't live in the south anymore so he's not surrounded by an echo chamber of new pro-confederacy talking points. He was led by the hurt in the voice of a friend who he loves and respects. The confederacy room became a virginia/america room, but it was really hard for him to separate ""confederacy stuff"" from ""virginia stuff"" because for him they've always been intertwined.

2020-06-25 19:24:41,mrinkyface,"I work for a university’s marketing department as a graphic designer, and last year I was chosen to represent the department for a regional meeting of marketing departments from various other universities. I hate serious public speaking and and nervous about saying something dumb, over speaking, and generally not knowing facts. I only spent a day preparing as it was short notice that I’d be going based on the original person going being gone for a few days for a family emergency. 

So I get into this meeting and basically start to think that if I screw up it’s ok because everyone here knows things changed last minute with me being there, which makes me calm down and relax. Basically try to be nice, accommodating, and help people out before the meeting starts so I have a chance to meet some of them before things start. I sat attentively throughout the meeting, presented my stuff, asked questions, and generally tried to think of it as a conversations between friends that were light hearted and fun. Afterwards they have a catered lunch to enjoy and I ask the people around me what drinks they’d like so I can get them, and then casually sit around talking to people in all the different teams handing my work card out to everyone I talk to. Meeting ends and I walk out with a bunch of them and then leave to go home when I’m asked to have drinks with the group, which I did before excusing myself soon after to “go back to work to finish things up” which really meant I was going home because it’s Friday and I have better things to do.

Monday comes around and I walk into my office with everyone congratulating me for the good job I did as they got a bunch of calls saying how much a bunch of them enjoyed me being there, how well I conveyed ideas and information, and how professional and kind I was. Even got to have breakfast with the university president to further discuss some of the ideas I had brought up in that meeting. When I finally am able to sit down at my desk I have a bunch of emails from the people at the meeting, all wanting me to add them to Facebook or LinkedIn. Most were really hot women that seemed out of my league, and all of them messaged me immediately after adding them about how they liked how nice and professional I was and that they were hoping I would meet up with them sometime soon for dinner or a coffee. Talked to a work colleague that usually goes about it and she told me they all said they had the hots for me based on them texting her over the weekend about me. All of them saying how they all liked me after only a few minutes because they could tell I was being myself and were really impressed with how confident, knowledgeable, and personable I was. Pretty much made us both laugh because usually I am awkward at work because people surprise me to talk when I’m zoned out designing stuff. The rest of the department caught on when they took me out for drinks later and realized that I was only awkward when I was interrupted while working. Still work with them and now it’s the best job I’ve ever had.

TL;DR: have to sub in for a regional marketing meeting, do really well, and end up getting a bunch of beautiful women from the meeting to swoon and try to date me afterwards."

I had absolutely zero idea who he was and was just behind him in the queue at the counter.

There were loads of people peeking around corners at him and me. Still being oblivious, I said jokingly to him ""I know I'm good looking but I'm not that good looking. Perhaps it's you they're after"". He laughed and we had a little chat about how we'd be spending Christmas whilst his girlfriend was finished being served. Nice guy, just really normal.

Then when he left the shop, a load of people came over asking how he was, what he was doing, did I get autograph, how do you know him etc. I was completely confused until the wife, who had been standing there starstruck, explained who he was.

Maybe he was just glad to have a normal conversation with someone but, like I said, just came across as a decent young bloke."

He was a gun nut (made his own bullets and had a room in the house dedicated to guns) Rush Limbaugh fan, and general right wing the democrats are evil  fan.  So I went online registered him as a democrat and found every left liberal group I could and signed him up for their phone campaign email list etc.  I cancelled his membership to the gun club. I put an Obama sticker on his Jeep. We lived in an affluent area so I made a few small donations in his name to the Hilliary campaign and reached out to headquarters to find out about hosting an event for Hillary in our area. For two months before the election he had everyone bombarding his home and work phone with calls.  I would put up signs in front of his house for Hillary so he would have to come home every day and take them down.  He was so furious.  His wife finally told him it was me.  He has never picked on me about veal since."

2020-06-25 19:24:09,Xello_99,"So I actually had to look that up as I’m very rarely sick.  I didn’t found a number for total sick days. But I believe there is no such thing in Germany. Say you are ill for 5 days each month. There’s really nothing your employer can do about it, he has to pay you. He can however demand further evidence for your illness, should you be away suspiciously often. But what I did found is this: your employer is required by law to pay you your normal salary for up to 30 workdays (so 6 weeks) in case of a serious illness. After that your insurance will pay you (although not the full salary I believe; but at least a substantial part of it). Only after one year of sickness is your employer allowed to try to fire you. But even then it’s a case by case decision. I think it’s all about wether you will be able to do the work again once you’re healthy (say you lost an arm, you won’t be able to drive a car anymore).

And by the way, you can call in sick on your vacation day as well. That way it will not be counted as a vacation but as a sick day, and you will be able to have that vacation another time."

Granted the whole no personality thing isn't from the ADD alone but it definitely didn't help.

2020-06-25 19:23:18,throwawayyyyyprawn,"Man this question hits home, I don't know how to answer with out going TLDR.

I spent from 13 to 20 years old high, anxious and depressed. I hung out with bad influences because we were loyal long term friends. I went to rehab for meth, I did shit tonnes of party drugs too, but when I finally realized that weed was my crutch my life changed. I stopped all drugs at different points but I finally stopped weed aswell, and moved back in with my parents after dropping out of uni. I started painting more street art as a way to stay out of trouble. It took me like a full year to recover and start becoming more confident, I got cheated on and my first real heart break, and then at around 21 years old I decided I was going to start living, no more Mr nice guy. That girl treated my like shit but she helped make me who I am today, so I'm not mad. 

Basically I stopped being nice to girls and yeah, life happened. Turns out that I always overthink, and was too ""nice"" to even try flirt, I had no idea, I didn't want to be imposing. When I stopped treating women like frigile little angels, and starting treating them like actual friends, I found out I'm pretty good with women. 

I don't know how or why, but I decided I'm going to start painting illegal graffiti instead of street art, I got fucking addicted. I went from being a nobody painting legal walls in small suburbs to being one of the top artists in the country. I did more in 2015-2018 than most guys do in their life. I became famous and infamous, I made so many enimies, I started standing up for myself. I can't explain this well enough, but shit just changed. I'm looked up to and respected by all my peers as well as thousands and thousands of people online. I would never have imagined that 7 years ago. People revere me. 

I've kinda grown up now and taken to some old man hobbies as I get closer to 30, I don't paint too much anymore but I stole my little slice of history and it makes me happy when I look back at it. I haven't fully stopped but I'm slowing down. 

PS. Graffiti is the dumbest, most toxic, hypermasculine, risky hobby out there. It's so fucking stupid. Don't do it. And don't try call me out questioning the morality, I know, I dedicated almost a decade to it. I'm litterally an expert. It's bad, you don't need to tell me."

Teacher be like: *Here..here is a book you haven't heard about, in a genre you don't like to begin with, and I'm gonna drill you with a dozen questions and an essay explaining why your opinion on the book, and why it's like mine.*

-What if I don't like the book?

*If you want to pass this assignment, you will.*

-Fuck.

My teenage life summed up.

All this turmoil happened on even the books I had a choice on what to read. I still think that my life would be no different if I never read the books. I just didn't see the point. Still don't.

Forced reading is no different than reading a history book and taking tests on it. At least History class doesn't clusterfuck the process of a good grade by requiring the correct opinion on something. That class is all about names, dates, locations, and cause and affect logic. How one event lead to another. That's it. Hated the course, and still thought it was relatively easy to pass."

2020-06-25 19:23:12,NoGlzy,"The big alternative would be anything under the large umbrella of socialism. 

A basic shared idea of socialism is that the basic necessities of live and the means to produce those things (food and farms, material stuff and factories etc. etc.) are not owned by individuals for profit, but by the group of people who rely on them. The various branches of socialism have differing ideas about how they are owned, how decisions are made, blah blah.


For socialists, the idea that you can be rich enough to buy things other people need and then sell it back to them for a profit is kinda crappy and should be done away with. It only serves to make the rich richer and to produce things in whatever way makes the biggest profit. Sure some individuals might be acting in the interests of others, but at some point someone is probably getting the bad end of the deal.

Capitalism incentivises greed. If you are greedy, under capitalism, you can amass vast quantities of wealth at the expense of others and thats kinda dumb. 

Socialism leans towards working for the good of people in general, not for profit. Think of all the scientists and engineers working for the love of discovery and advancement, what if they could put their efforts in that direction, rather than whatever will make the next iphone sell really well. Think of all the artists and musicians who can't work on their shit because they have to work double shifts to pay rent. What if the necessary work was shared to give more people more time to live a better life.

Hell, what if noone was starving on the streets despite there being more than enough food to go around or dying because their gofundme didnt meet the right amout of money to buy their meds, made so overpriced by greedy pharmaceutical companies.

People always point out starvation under the soviet union or whatever but it kinda just feels like they havent looked at their own countries *especially* the US. Capitalism is killing people there and here in the UK. It's just also really good at not telling you about it. Remember, capitalists own the media ;).

One particular flavour of socialism is libertarian socialism or ""anarchism"". Broadly, anarchism is against unnecessary heirarchy. Noone should be innately more important or have power over others. That should only happen in very specific circumstances. There are lots of free recources online about anarchism, if you want to have a read and see what you think.

One thing socialists are very good at is arguing about which kind of socialism is the best or most effective. It's best, if you are interested in alternatives to capitalism, to read the basic intros to the ideas and see what tickles your pickle.

You might thing socialism is terrible, or you might agree with a lot of it. Only one way to find out. Also most pro-capitalists are absolute dorks who like wearing business suits and sound like Ben Shapiro, and that counts for a lot."

This is bc there was some very racist shows in the past that used white men painted black ('blackface') with over exaggerated (large), red lips, who represented a black person, and never in a good way (often reinforcing negative stereotypes, e.g. being animalistic), hence why people don't like it. 

TLDR; historically, painting a black face AND having (emphasised) red lips was used in racist shows in the past to reinforce bad black stereotypes (e.g. being 'animals'), and this 'wave' of PC culture is why it's ('suddenly') being called racist"

The other neighbors  great Dane had jumped the chain link fence (its 3.5 feet and not nearly big enough for that dog, as this has happened several times before)  and was tearing up the scotty in the old guys yard. The old guy got bit trying to pull this goliath dog off the scotty.
 I took off cleared the fence like a hurdle, tackled the Dane who flipped around, and grabbed my boot. I didnt even realize I still had a mechanics hammer in my hand, I brought it down on that dogs head and killed it. I had no intention of killing the dog but it was one of those things that just happened. 
Dad was behind me shortly and called the ambulance for the old guy. the neighbors called the cops cause I killed a ""prised winning pure bred"" dane. The Scotty was so tore up that he died before the ambulance came for the old guy, but he got to hold the dog one last time. it was the only thing he really cared about after his wife and daughter died a few years back the dog really messed up the old guy. 

They sued me and the old guy, they lost, had to ""fix the fence in a manner that ""will contain any animals they possess"" and I got a new pair of boots in a court ordered settlement."

Peel them really well: The outer, darker green leaves are bitter and hard, you don't want those. If you think you've removed enough of those, remove a few more. Then boil them. Not too much, they'll get bitter. Drain and add some butter. Then they'll be delicious, soft, buttery and creamy. I like to mash them with some boiled potatoes."

Not to mention the pollutants themselves potentially causing interstitial lung diseases in general, which could then go on to exacerbate the effects of certain epidemics and pandemics alike.

2020-06-25 19:21:52,Baileythenerd,"So, I lived in South Brazil, which is a very important distinction. 

It's a beautiful country, the area I was in was primarily colonized by the polish so you can see a lot of that in their populations and architecture. 

The environment was generally warm/hot and pretty humid. 

The most notable thing about it was the INCREDIBLE split economically. My first host family was a rich doctor who had a 3 story house on a lake in the middle of a forest. 

My other host families had smaller houses/apartments in the city. 

IN the city you can see a lot of gorgeous marble palaces/buildings that are government owned which are guarded by a number of police with larger guns. 

NEXT TO these large gorgeous marble buildings it was very common to see droves of homeless people, most carrying all their belongings on large carts dragged behind them (imagine something an ox would be pulling), many of them were missing limbs and using makeshift crutches. Stray dogs were everywhere. 

Anybody who wasn't desperately poor or homeless would ignore these homeless people literally as if they did not exist. I saw a man die on the streets there because he was having a seizure or something and literally nobody stopped to help him.  

Aside from the very obvious blind eye to the poor, everyone was very nice and friendly. 

Oh, also the high school I went to got into a gang war with a rival high school a few blocks away, the police came by and had an assembly about it- they got booed off stage. 

So that was fun."

They're going down the line and they get to Jones, a pretty average dude from West Virginia with a heavy southern accent. He gets a package and proceeds to kneel down and pop it open. Out of my periphery I see his head drop and he sighs. Our SDS caught it as well and asked Jones ""What'd ya get, *pri*?""

I can hear Jones muttering something about kicking his buddies' asses under his breath when the goofy kid of the platoon blurts out ""*Knowing where you're from, I would've expected a farm animal.*""

My grandma had one rule about my mom staying in this house that she owned, and the rule was that she was not allowed to leave my sister alone there for weeks at a time, which she did anyway. One time, my sister was seriously injured and my grandma was the only person available to take her to the hospital. 

My mom hated one of my friends, and said that I was not allowed to have this particular friend over. She, of course, went on many trips so I had the friend over anyway. Me and my two friends would chill at the house, drink, and keep an eye on my sister. 

My mom found out that I was having the friend over, and she absolutely lost her fucking mind over it. She called me and threatened me in every single way imaginable. I said to her, “you’re going to regret that”. Got off the phone, called my grandma, and told her that my mom left my sister alone, again, for who knows how long. My grandma lost her shit. The preceding events actually lead to a ten year Cold War between my grandma and my mother and the rest of my family. There was tension anyway, and it blew up. Mom abandoned my family and moved to Florida to be with her boyfriend, and her relationships with my family are still tense (to say the least) to this day. 

I go out of my way now to make things extra difficult and uncomfortable for her because she’s not a good person and I don’t want her to hurt any more people that I care about, especially myself."

Very well then, you go on believing that all of your secrets are safe when contained in a paper envelope with an easily and undetectably defeated seal, which is also easily stolen entirely.  Best of luck in that


Copy/pasta?  As tempting as a dish by that name may sound, no. it is a term that arose I think during the early 2ks which meant copy/paste, but which made the phrase funny.  Maybe you should try getting up to date on the modern lexicon.


Maybe that is the source of our contention.. The pony express is obsolete, the telegraph has come and gone. Paper envelopes aren't really that secure.  Welcome to the future."

2020-06-25 19:21:16,Felix_the_cat99,Honestly I think the governments that hold significant power would still wage some type of war. Claiming that they might just be grooming us into letting them farm us as slaves for whatever purpose they desire. And then we all die because why wouldn’t we just take the gifts? I’m sure they’d just enslave us immediately if that was their intent.
2020-06-25 19:21:16,stink3rbelle,"I think a lot of people want to experience pregnancy, or a partner's pregnancy. I do not have kids and am not close to planning them, but I know I do would like to experience that. I *also* have always been interested in adopting. It's something my grandma and my aunt did, and I feel it enriched our family.

For many people, IVF and other fertility treatment costs are not the hugest deal, and they also offer a greater potential for immediacy than adoption. Adoption also costs money, and can take significant time. IVF can require multiple rounds, but the timeline for when you will know whether it works is knowable, while adoption can be more mysterious.

Fair or not, our culture often considers genetic offspring as ""children,"" and other styles of parentage lesser. People care a TON about being the genetic father to their children, and in eras when DNA tests were not available, many cultures severely restricted women so that fathers would know their children were ""theirs."" It's not necessarily individuals' prejudices so much as individuals being a part of the wider culture.

Adoption laws also used to be kind of gronked up, and added complexity to raising your adopted child. Basically, in the 1920s or 1930s this one asshole woman created a scheme to make a buttload of money off of adoptions, and a big part of that was cutting birth parents off, and even stealing children. She paraded around these ideals of ""helping unfortunate children"" and became *highly* influential nationwide on adoption culture and adoption laws. To make the most money, she wanted to cut birth parents off entirely, and eventually that became the prevailing law around adoption across the whole country. ""Closed"" adoptions are still the default. And that's tough on adopted kids. Kids take part in the wider culture, and interact with other children whose parents are also their genetic parents. Being curious about your genetic relatives is natural for many, but that ""closed"" adoption process means kids don't get to hear *anything* about their genetic relatives before they turn 18.

Finally, a lot of children who are up for adoption are not white, while a lot of would-be adopting parents are white (in the US). Even if you aren't prejudiced at all yourself, you've got to be aware of the prejudices around you. Raising a kid who looks different from you has its own set of challenges, and not everyone is up to the cross-cultural task."
