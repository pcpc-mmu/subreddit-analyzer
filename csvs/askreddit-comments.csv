They also don't want you take 520 hours at one time because you'd be out for 2 months. So you can sell them back if you're at the limit and just trade the hours for the money you'd get if you used them. So you get the same money either way."

Every time I look behind me he‚Äôs under a closer street lamp - with his creepy ass mouth agape and just staring at me as he‚Äôs slowly pedaling toward me - and I start to figure out these outlines are people he‚Äôs run over and killed with this tricycle and right as the squeaky tricycle sounded RIGHT behind me I woke up.

2020-07-16 10:10:11,j-finley,"I used to work warehouse floor and just happened to be the only woman. I had really bad cramps that day, and  one of my co-workers checked up on me and asked if I was ok. At that stage I was just working through the pain and clearly looked uncomfortable.

I told him that I was just in a lot of pain I'd be fine. he offered to get me some water or a can of coke (sugar can help) and told me to sit down if needed. Not batting an eye and just wanted to make me more comfortable and not feel weird about it. (I know it sounds silly but in environment where there isnt anyone else that dosnent have periods it can be quite daunting to talk about it.)

And honestly I think back at and feel like that was one of the loveliest moments. He is a literal angel. 

Honestly there is nothing too much you can do about cramps some girls get really bad ones.  But my co-worker noticed I was uncomfortable, checked up on me, and asked if he could help way. Which was attentive and thoughtful of him.

Ultimately showing that you care and you are willing to help in anyway is the best way to approach it. Sometimes that's getting a hot water bottle or let some one  complaint and feel heard. Every one shows care in there own way and I think you cant go wrong as  long as you exercise that muscle.

Not all people experience periods the same way so I don't think there is a set expectations, I don't think there is anything wrong in asking the person either what they needs are in that moment"
